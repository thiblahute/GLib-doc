fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "regex-syntax.html#assertions", "fragment": "Assertions \nAn assertion is a test on the characters following or preceding the current matching point that does not actually consume any characters. The simple assertions coded as b B A G Z z and are described above. \nMore complicated assertions are coded as subpatterns. There are two kinds those that look ahead of the current position in the string and those that look behind it. An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way except that it does not cause the current matching position to be changed. \nAssertion subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns and may not be repeated because it makes no sense to assert the same thing several times. If any kind of assertion contains capturing subpatterns within it these are counted for the purposes of numbering the capturing subpatterns in the whole pattern. However substring capturing is carried out only for positive assertions because it does not make sense for negative assertions. \n"});
