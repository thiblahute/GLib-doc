Unlike a dot it always matches any line ending characters. The feature is provided in Perl in order to match individual bytes in UTF mode. Because it breaks up UTF characters into individual bytes what remains in the string may be a malformed UTF string. For this reason the C escape sequence is best avoided. \nGRegex does not allow C to appear in lookbehind assertions described below because in UTF mode this would make it impossible to calculate the length of the lookbehind. \n"});
