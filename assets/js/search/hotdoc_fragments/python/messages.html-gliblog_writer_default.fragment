On Linux this is typically the systemd journal falling back to stdout or stderr if running from the terminal or if output is being redirected to a file. \nSupport for other platform specific logging mechanisms may be added in future. Distributors of GLib may modify this function to impose their own documented platform specific log writing policies. \nThis is suitable for use as a GLib.LogWriterFunc and is the default writer used if no other is set using GLib.log_set_writer_func. \nAs with GLib.log_default_handler this function drops debug and informational messages unless their log domain or all is listed in the space separated G_MESSAGES_DEBUG environment variable. \n"});
