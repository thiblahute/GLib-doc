If mutex is already locked by another thread the current thread will block until mutex is unlocked by the other thread. \nGMutex is neither guaranteed to be recursive nor to be non recursive. As such calling GLib.Mutex.lock on a GMutex that has already been locked by the same thread results in undefined behaviour including but not limited to deadlocks \n"});
