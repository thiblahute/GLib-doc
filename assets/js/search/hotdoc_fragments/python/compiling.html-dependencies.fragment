Beyond a C compiler which must implement C90 but does not need to implement C99 the two tools needed during the build process as differentiated from the tools used in when creating GLib mentioned above such as autoconf are pkg config and GNU make. \npkg config is a tool for tracking the compilation flags needed for libraries that are used by the GLib library. For each library a small pc text file is installed in a standard location that contains the compilation flags needed for that library along with version number information. The version of pkg config needed to build GLib is mirrored in the dependencies directory on the GTK FTP site. \nThe GLib Makefiles make use of several features specific to GNU make and will not build correctly with other versions of make. You will need to install it if you don t already have it on your system. It may be called gmake rather than make. \nA UNIX build of GLib requires that the system implements at least the original version of POSIX. Beyond this it depends on a number of other libraries. \nThe GNU libiconv library is needed to build GLib if your system doesn t have the iconv function for doing conversion between character encodings. Most modern systems should have iconv however many older systems lack an iconv implementation. On such systems you must install the libiconv library. This can be found at http www.gnu.org software libiconv. \nIf your system has an iconv implementation but you want to use libiconv instead you can pass the with libiconv option to configure. This forces libiconv to be used. \nNote that if you have libiconv installed in your default include search path for instance in usr local but don t enable it you will get an error while compiling GLib because the iconv.h that libiconv installs hides the system iconv. \nIf you are using the native iconv implementation on Solaris instead of libiconv you ll need to make sure that you have the converters between locale encodings and UTF installed. At a minimum you ll need the SUNWuiu8 package. You probably should also install the SUNWciu8 SUNWhiu8 SUNWjiu8 and SUNWkiu8 packages. \nThe native iconv on Compaq Tru64 doesn t contain support for UTF so you ll need to use GNU libiconv instead. When using GNU libiconv for GLib you ll need to use GNU libiconv for GNU gettext as well. This probably applies to related operating systems as well. \nThe libintl library from the GNU gettext package is needed if your system doesn t have the gettext functionality for handling message translation databases. \nA thread implementation is needed. The thread support in GLib can be based upon POSIX threads or win32 threads. \nGRegex uses the PCRE library for regular expression matching. The default is to use the internal version of PCRE that is patched to use GLib for memory management and Unicode handling. If you prefer to use the system supplied PCRE library you can pass the with pcre system option to but it is not recommended. \nThe optional extended attribute support in GIO requires the getxattr family of functions that may be provided by glibc or by the standalone libattr library. To build GLib without extended attribute support use the disable xattr option. \nThe optional SELinux support in GIO requires libselinux. To build GLib without SELinux support use the disable selinux option. \nThe optional support for DTrace requires the sys sdt.h header which is provided by SystemTap on Linux. To build GLib without DTrace use the disable dtrace configure option. \nThe optional support for SystemTap can be disabled with the disable systemtap configure option. \n"});
