If you supplied a value_destroy_func when creating the GLib.Tree the old value is freed using that function. If you supplied a key_destroy_func when creating the GLib.Tree the passed key is freed using that function. \nThe tree is automatically balanced as new key value pairs are added so that the distance from the root to every leaf is as small as possible. \n"});
