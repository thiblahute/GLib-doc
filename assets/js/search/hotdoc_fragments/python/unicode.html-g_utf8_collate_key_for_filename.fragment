Most dictionary orderings seem to consider it insignificant thus producing the ordering event.c eventgenerator.c event.h instead of event.c event.h eventgenerator.c Also we would like to treat numbers intelligently so that file1 file10 file5 is sorted as file1 file5 file10 \nNote that this function depends on the current locale setlocale \n"});
