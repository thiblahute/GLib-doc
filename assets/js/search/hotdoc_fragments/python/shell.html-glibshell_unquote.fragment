fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/shell.html#glibshell_unquote", "fragment": "GLib.shell_unquote \nUnquotes a string as the shell bin sh would. Only handles quotes if a string contains file globs arithmetic operators variables backticks redirections or other special to the shell features the result will be different from the result a real shell would produce the variables backticks etc. will be passed through literally instead of being expanded This function is guaranteed to succeed if applied to the result of GLib.shell_quote. If it fails it returns None and sets the error. The quoted_string need not actually contain quoted or escaped text GLib.shell_unquote simply goes through the string and unquotes unescapes anything that the shell would. Both single and double quotes are handled as are escapes including escaped newlines. The return value must be freed with GLib.free. Possible errors are in the G_SHELL_ERROR not introspectable domain. \nShell quoting rules are a bit strange. Single quotes preserve the literal string exactly. escape sequences are not allowed not even if you want a in the quoted text you have to do something like foo bar Double quotes allow and newline to be escaped with backslash. Otherwise double quotes preserve things literally. \n"});
