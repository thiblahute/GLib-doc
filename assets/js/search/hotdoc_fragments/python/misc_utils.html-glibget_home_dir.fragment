This was changed to increase the compatibility of GLib with other programs and the XDG basedir specification and to increase testability of programs based on GLib by making it easier to run them from test frameworks \nIf your program has a strong requirement for either the new or the old behaviour and if you don t wish to increase your GLib dependency to ensure that the new behaviour is in effect then you should either directly check the HOME environment variable yourself or unset it before calling any functions in GLib. \n"});
