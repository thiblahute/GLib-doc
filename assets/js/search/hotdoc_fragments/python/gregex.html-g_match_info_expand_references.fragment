fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gregex.html#g_match_info_expand_references", "fragment": "GLib.MatchInfo.expand_references \nReturns a new string containing the text in string_to_expand with references and escape sequences expanded. References refer to the last match done with string against regex and have the same syntax used by GLib.Regex.replace. \nThe string_to_expand must be UTF encoded even if GLib.RegexCompileFlags.raw was passed to GLib.Regex.new. \nThe backreferences are extracted from the string passed to the match function so you cannot call this function after freeing the string. \nmatch_info may be None in which case string_to_expand must not contain references. For instance foo n does not refer to an actual pattern and n merely will be replaced with n character while to expand whole match one needs the result of a match. Use GLib.regex_check_replacement to find out whether string_to_expand contains references. \n"});
