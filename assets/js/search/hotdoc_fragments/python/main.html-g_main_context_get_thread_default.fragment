fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#g_main_context_get_thread_default", "fragment": "GLib.main_context_get_thread_default \nGets the thread default GLib.MainContext for this thread. Asynchronous operations that want to be able to be run in contexts other than the default one should call this method or GLib.main_context_ref_thread_default to get a GLib.MainContext to add their GLib.Source to. Note that even in single threaded programs applications may sometimes want to temporarily push a non default context so it is not safe to assume that this will always return None if you are running in the default thread. \nIf you need to hold a reference on the context use GLib.main_context_ref_thread_default instead. \n"});
