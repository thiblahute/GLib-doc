It need not even be unique on your local network or site but usually it is. Callers should not rely on the return value having any specific properties like uniqueness for security purposes. Even if the name of the machine is changed while an application is running the return value from this function does not change. The returned string is owned by GLib and should not be modified or freed. If no name can be determined a default fixed string localhost is returned. \n"});
