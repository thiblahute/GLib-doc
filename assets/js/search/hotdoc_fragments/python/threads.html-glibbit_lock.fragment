If the bit is already set this call will block until GLib.bit_unlock unsets the corresponding bit. \nAttempting to lock on two different bits within the same integer is not supported and will very probably cause deadlocks. \nThe value of the bit that is set is u bit If bit is not between and then the result is undefined. \nThis function accesses address atomically. All other accesses to address must be atomic in order for this function to work reliably. \n"});
