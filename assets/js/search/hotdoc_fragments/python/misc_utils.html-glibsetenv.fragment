On UNIX both the variable s name and value can be arbitrary byte strings except that the variable s name cannot contain On Windows they should be in UTF \nNote that on some systems when variables are overwritten the memory used for the previous variables and its value isn t reclaimed. \nYou should be mindful of the fact that environment variable handling in UNIX is not thread safe and your program may crash if one thread calls GLib.setenv while another thread is calling getenv. And note that many functions such as gettext call getenv internally. This function is only safe to use at the very start of your program before creating any other threads or creating objects that create worker threads of their own \nIf you need to set up the environment for a child process you can use GLib.get_environ to get an environment array modify that with GLib.environ_setenv and GLib.environ_unsetenv and then pass that array directly to execvpe GLib.spawn_async or the like. \n"});
