The particular set of replacements that is done may change by version or even by runtime environment. \nIf the source language of str is known it can used to improve the accuracy of the translation by passing it as from_locale. It should be a valid POSIX locale string of the form language _territory codeset modifier \nIf from_locale is None then the current locale is used. \nIf you want to do translation for no specific locale and you want it to be done independently of the currently locale specify C for from_locale. \n"});
