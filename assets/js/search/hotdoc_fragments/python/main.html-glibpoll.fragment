fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#glibpoll", "fragment": "GLib.poll \nPolls fds as with the poll system call but portably. On systems that don t have poll it is emulated using select. This is used internally by GLib.MainContext but it can be called directly if you need to block until a file descriptor is ready but don t want to run the full main loop. \nEach element of fds is a GLib.PollFD describing a single file descriptor to poll. The fd field indicates the file descriptor and the events field indicates the events to poll for. On return the revents fields will be filled with the events that actually occurred. \nOn POSIX systems the file descriptors in fds can be any sort of file descriptor but the situation is much more complicated on Windows. If you need to use GLib.poll in code that has to run on Windows the easiest solution is to construct all of your GLib.PollFD with g_io_channel_win32_make_pollfd. \n"});
