fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#glibsourceset_name", "fragment": "GLib.Source.set_name \nSets a name for the source used in debugging and profiling. The name defaults to None. \nThe source name should describe in a human readable way what the source does. For example X11 event queue or GTK repaint idle handler or whatever it is. \nIt is permitted to call this function multiple times but is not recommended due to the potential performance impact. For example one could change the name in the check function of a GLib.SourceFuncs to include details like the event type in the source name. \nUse caution if changing the name while another thread may be accessing it with GLib.Source.get_name that function does not copy the value and changing the value will free it while the other thread may be attempting to use it. \n"});
