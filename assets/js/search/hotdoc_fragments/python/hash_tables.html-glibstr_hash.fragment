The bit unsigned hash value starts at and for each byte c in the string is updated hash hash c. This function uses the signed value of each byte. \nIt can be passed to g_hash_table_new not introspectable as the hash_func parameter when using non NULL strings as keys in a GLib.HashTable. \nNote that this function may not be a perfect fit for all use cases. For example it produces some hash collisions with strings as short as \n"});
