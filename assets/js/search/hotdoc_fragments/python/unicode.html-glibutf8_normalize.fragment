The string has to be valid UTF otherwise None is returned. You should generally call GLib.utf8_normalize before comparing two Unicode strings. \nThe normalization mode GLib.NormalizeMode.default only standardizes differences that do not affect the text content such as the above mentioned accent representation. GLib.NormalizeMode.all also standardizes the compatibility characters in Unicode such as SUPERSCRIPT THREE to the standard forms in this case DIGIT THREE Formatting information may be lost but for most text operations such characters should be considered the same. \nGLib.NormalizeMode.default_compose and GLib.NormalizeMode.all_compose are like GLib.NormalizeMode.default and GLib.NormalizeMode.all but returned a result with composed forms rather than a maximally decomposed form. This is often useful if you intend to convert the string to a legacy encoding or pass it to a system with less capable Unicode handling. \n"});
