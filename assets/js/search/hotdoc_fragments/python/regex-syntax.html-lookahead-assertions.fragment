For example \nmatches a word followed by a semicolon but does not include the semicolon in the match and \nmatches any occurrence of foo that is not followed by bar Note that the apparently similar pattern \ndoes not find an occurrence of bar that is preceded by something other than foo it finds any occurrence of bar whatsoever because the assertion foo is always true when the next three characters are bar A lookbehind assertion is needed to achieve the other effect. \nIf you want to force a matching failure at some point in a pattern the most convenient way to do it is with because an empty string always matches so an assertion that requires there not to be an empty string must always fail. \n"});
