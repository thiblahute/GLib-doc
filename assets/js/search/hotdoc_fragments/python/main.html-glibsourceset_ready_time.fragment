fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#glibsourceset_ready_time", "fragment": "GLib.Source.set_ready_time \nSets a GLib.Source to be dispatched when the given monotonic time is reached or passed If the monotonic time is in the past as it always will be if ready_time is then the source will be dispatched immediately. \nIf ready_time is then the source is never woken up on the basis of the passage of time. \nDispatching the source does not reset the ready time. You should do so yourself from the source dispatch function. \nNote that if you have a pair of sources where the ready time of one suggests that it will be delivered first but the priority for the other suggests that it would be delivered first and the ready time for both sources is reached during the same main context iteration then the order of dispatch is undefined. \nIt is a no op to call this function on a GLib.Source which has already been destroyed with GLib.Source.destroy. \nThis API is only intended to be used by implementations of GLib.Source. Do not call this API on a GLib.Source that you did not create. \n"});
