For that reason waiting on a condition variable should always be in a loop based on an explicitly checked predicate. \nTrue is returned if the condition variable was signalled or in the case of a spurious wakeup False is returned if end_time has passed. \nThe following code shows how to correctly perform a timed wait on a condition variable extending the example presented in the documentation for GLib.Cond \nNotice that the end time is calculated once before entering the loop and reused. This is the motivation behind the use of absolute time on this API if a relative time of seconds were passed directly to the call and a spurious wakeup occurred the program would have to start over waiting again which would lead to a total wait time of more than seconds \n"});
