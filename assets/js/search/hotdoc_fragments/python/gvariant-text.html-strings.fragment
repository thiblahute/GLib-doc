For example to specify the character you just write You could also give the Unicode codepoint of that character U E9 as the escape sequence u00e9 Since the strings are pure Unicode you should not attempt to encode the utf byte sequence corresponding to the string using escapes it won t work and you ll end up with the individual characters corresponding to each byte. \nUnicode escapes of the form uxxxx and Uxxxxxxxx are supported in hexidecimal. The usual control sequence escapes a b f n r t and v are supported. Additionally a before a newline character causes the newline to be ignored. Finally any other character following is copied literally for example or but for forwards compatibility with future additions you should only use this feature when necessary for escaping backslashes or quotes. \nThe usual octal and hexidecimal escapes nnn and xnn are not supported here. Those escapes are used to encode byte values and GVariant strings are Unicode. \nSingle character strings are not interpreted as bytes. Bytes must be specified by their numerical value. \n"});
