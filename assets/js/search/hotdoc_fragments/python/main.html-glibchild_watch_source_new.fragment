Typically you will want to call GLib.spawn_close_pid in the callback function for the source. \nNote further that using GLib.child_watch_source_new is not compatible with calling waitpid with a nonpositive first argument in the application. Calling waitpid for individual pids will still work fine. \nSimilarly on POSIX platforms the pid passed to this function must be greater than i.e. this function must wait for a specific child and cannot wait for one of many children by using a nonpositive argument \n"});
