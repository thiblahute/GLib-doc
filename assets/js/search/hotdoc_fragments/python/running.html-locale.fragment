Therefore most GLib using applications should call setlocale LC_ALL to set up the current locale. \nOn Windows in a C program there are several locale concepts that not necessarily are synchronized. On one hand there is the system default ANSI code page which determines what encoding is used for file names handled by the C library s functions and the Win32 API. We are talking about the narrow functions here that take character pointers not the wide ones. \nOn the other hand there is the C library s current locale. The character set code page used by that is not necessarily the same as the system default ANSI code page. Strings in this character set are returned by functions like strftime \nglib ships with a set of python macros for the gdb debugger. These includes pretty printers for lists hashtables and gobject types. It also has a backtrace filter that makes backtraces with signal emissions easier to read. \nTo use this you need a recent enough gdb that supports python scripting. Gdb should be recent enough but branches of the archer gdb tree as used in Fedora and Fedora should work too. You then need to install glib in the same prefix as gdb so that the python gdb autoloaded files get installed in the right place for gdb to pick up. \nGeneral pretty printing should just happen without having to do anything special. To get the signal emission filtered backtrace you must use the new backtrace command instead of the standard one. \nThere is also a new command called gforeach that can be used to apply a command on each item in a list. E.g. you can do \nWhich would print the contents of each widget in a list of widgets. \n"});
