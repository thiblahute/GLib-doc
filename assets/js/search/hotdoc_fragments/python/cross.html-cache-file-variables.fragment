Doesn t need to be set if you are compiling using trio. \nglib_cv_stack_grows yes no \nWhether the stack grows up or down. Most places will want no A few architectures such as PA RISC need yes \nglib_cv_working_bcopy yes no \nWhether your bcopy can handle overlapping copies. Only needs to be set if you don t have memmove Very unlikely \nglib_cv_sane_realloc yes no \nWhether your realloc conforms to ANSI C and can handle NULL as the first argument. Defaults to yes and probably doesn t need to be set. \nglib_cv_have_strlcpy yes no \nWhether you have strlcpy that matches OpenBSD. Defaults to no which is safe since GLib uses a built in version in that case. \nglib_cv_have_qsort_r yes no \nWhether you have qsort_r that matches BSD. Defaults to no which is safe since GLib uses a built in version in that case. \nglib_cv_va_val_copy yes no \nWhether va_list can be copied as a pointer. If set to no then memcopy will be used. Only matters if you don t have va_copy or __va_copy So doesn t matter for GCC. Defaults to yes which is slightly more common than no \nglib_cv_rtldglobal_broken yes no \nWhether you have a bug found in OSF v5.0. Defaults to no \nglib_cv_uscore yes no \nWhether an underscore needs to be prepended to symbols when looking them up via dlsym Only needs to be set if your system uses dlopen dlsym \nac_cv_func_posix_getpwuid_r yes no \nWhether you have a getpwuid_r function in your C library not your thread library that conforms to the POSIX spec. Takes a struct passwd as the final argument \nac_cv_func_nonposix_getpwuid_r yes no \nWhether you have some variant of getpwuid_r that doesn t conform to to the POSIX spec but GLib might be able to use or might segfault. Only needs to be set if ac_cv_func_posix_getpwuid_r is not set. It s safest to set this to no \nac_cv_func_posix_getgrgid_r yes no \nWhether you have a getgrgid_r function that conforms to the POSIX spec. \nglib_cv_use_pid_surrogate yes no \nWhether to use a setpriority on the PID of the thread as a method for setting the priority of threads. This only needs to be set when using POSIX threads. \nac_cv_func_printf_unix98 yes no \nWhether your printf family supports Unix98 style N positional parameters. Defaults to no \nac_cv_func_vsnprintf_c99 yes no \nWhether you have a vsnprintf with C99 semantics. C99 semantics means returning the number of bytes that would have been written had the output buffer had enough space. Defaults to no \n"});
