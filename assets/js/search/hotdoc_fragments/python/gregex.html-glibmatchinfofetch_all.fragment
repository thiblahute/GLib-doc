fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gregex.html#glibmatchinfofetch_all", "fragment": "GLib.MatchInfo.fetch_all \nBundles up pointers to each of the matching substrings from a match and stores them in an array of gchar pointers. The first element in the returned array is the match number i.e. the entire matched text. \nIf a sub pattern didn t match anything e.g. sub pattern matching b against a b then an empty string is inserted. \nIf the last match was obtained using the DFA algorithm that is using GLib.Regex.match_all or GLib.Regex.match_all_full the retrieved strings are not that matched by sets of parentheses but that of the matched substring. Substrings are matched in reverse order of length so the first one is the longest match. \nThe strings are fetched from the string passed to the match function so you cannot call this function after freeing the string. \n"});
