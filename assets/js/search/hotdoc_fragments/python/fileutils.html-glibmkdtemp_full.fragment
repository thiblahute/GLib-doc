See the mkdtemp documentation on most UNIX like systems. \nThe parameter is a string that should follow the rules for mkdtemp templates i.e. contain the string XXXXXX GLib.mkdtemp_full is slightly more flexible than mkdtemp in that the sequence does not have to occur at the very end of the template and you can pass a mode.
