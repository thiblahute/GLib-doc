Calling this function outside of a test case sets the default base URI for all test cases. Calling it from within a test case changes the base URI for the scope of the test case only. Bug URIs are constructed by appending a bug specific URI portion to uri_pattern or by replacing the special string s within uri_pattern if that is present. \n"});
