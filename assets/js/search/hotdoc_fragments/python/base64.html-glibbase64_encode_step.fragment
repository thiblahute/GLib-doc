By calling this function multiple times you can convert data in chunks to avoid having to have the full encoded data in memory. \nWhen all of the data has been converted you must call GLib.base64_encode_close to flush the saved state. \nThe output buffer must be large enough to fit all the data that will be written to it. Due to the way base64 encodes you will need at least len bytes may be needed in case of non zero state If you enable line breaking you will need at least len bytes of extra space. \nbreak_lines is typically used when putting base64 encoded data in emails. It breaks the lines at columns instead of putting all of the text on the same line. This avoids problems with long lines in the email system. Note however that it breaks the lines with LF characters not CR LF sequences so the result cannot be passed directly to SMTP or certain other protocols. \n"});
