In particular when error is None False will be returned. \nIf domain contains a FAILED or otherwise generic error code you should generally not check for it explicitly but should instead treat any not explicitly recognized error code as being equivalent to the FAILED code. This way if the domain is extended in the future to provide a more specific error code for a certain case your code will still work. \n"});
