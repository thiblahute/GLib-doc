If the value inside the variant has a different type then None is returned. In the event that dictionary has a value type other than v then expected_type must directly match the key type and it is used to unpack the value directly or an error occurs. \nIn either case if key is not found in dictionary None is returned. \nIf the key is found and the value has the correct type it is returned. If expected_type was specified then any non NULL return value will have this type. \nThis function is currently implemented with a linear scan. If you plan to do many lookups then GLib.VariantDict may be more efficient. \n"});
