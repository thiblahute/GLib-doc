fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/unicode.html#glibunichar_decompose", "fragment": "GLib.unichar_decompose \nPerforms a single decomposition step of the Unicode canonical decomposition algorithm. \nThis function does not include compatibility decompositions. It does however include algorithmic Hangul Jamo decomposition as well as singleton decompositions which replace a character by a single other character. In the case of singletons b will be set to zero. \nIf ch is not decomposable a is set to ch and b is set to zero. \nNote that the way Unicode decomposition pairs are defined it is guaranteed that b would not decompose further but a may itself decompose. To get the full canonical decomposition for ch one would need to recursively call this function on a. Or use GLib.unichar_fully_decompose. \nSee UAX for details. \n"});
