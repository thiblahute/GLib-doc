Note that you must set the GLib.SpawnFlags.stdout_to_dev_null and GLib.SpawnFlags.stderr_to_dev_null flags when passing None for standard_output and standard_error. \nIf exit_status is non NULL the platform specific exit status of the child is stored there see the documentation of GLib.spawn_check_exit_status for how to use and interpret this. Note that it is invalid to pass GLib.SpawnFlags.do_not_reap_child in flags. \nIf an error occurs no data is returned in standard_output standard_error or exit_status. \nThis function calls GLib.spawn_async_with_pipes internally see that function for full details on the other parameters and details on how these functions work on Windows. \n"});
