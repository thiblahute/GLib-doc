If the function returns False it is automatically removed from the list of event sources and will not be called again. \nSee memory management of sources mainloop memory management for details on how to handle the return value and memory management of data. \nThis internally creates a main loop source using GLib.idle_source_new and attaches it to the global GLib.MainContext using GLib.Source.attach so the callback will be invoked in whichever thread is running that main context. You can do these steps manually if you need greater control or to use a custom main context. \n"});
