GNU gettext uses the character to separate the message context and message id in msgctxtid. If is passed as msgidoffset this function will fall back to trying to use the deprecated convention of using as a separation character. \nThis uses GLib.dgettext internally. See that functions for differences with dgettext proper. \nApplications should normally not use this function directly but use the C_ not introspectable macro for translations with context. \n"});
