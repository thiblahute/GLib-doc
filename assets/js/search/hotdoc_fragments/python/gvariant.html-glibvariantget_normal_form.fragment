fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gvariant.html#glibvariantget_normal_form", "fragment": "GLib.Variant.get_normal_form \nGets a GLib.Variant instance that has the same value as value and is trusted to be in normal form. \nIf value is already trusted to be in normal form then a new reference to value is returned. \nIf value is not already trusted then it is scanned to check if it is in normal form. If it is found to be in normal form then it is marked as trusted and a new reference to it is returned. \nIf value is found not to be in normal form then a new trusted GLib.Variant is created with the same value as value. \nIt makes sense to call this function if you ve received GLib.Variant data from untrusted sources and you want to ensure your serialised output is definitely in normal form. \n"});
