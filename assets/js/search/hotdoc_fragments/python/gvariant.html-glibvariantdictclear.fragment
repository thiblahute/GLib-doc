fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gvariant.html#glibvariantdictclear", "fragment": "GLib.VariantDict.clear \nReleases all memory associated with a GLib.VariantDict without freeing the GLib.VariantDict structure itself. \nIt typically only makes sense to do this on a stack allocated GLib.VariantDict if you want to abort building the value part way through. This function need not be called if you call GLib.VariantDict.end and it also doesn t need to be called on dicts allocated with g_variant_dict_new see GLib.VariantDict.unref for that \nIt is valid to call this function on either an initialised GLib.VariantDict or one that was previously cleared by an earlier call to GLib.VariantDict.clear but it is not valid to call this function on uninitialised memory. \n"});
