The data need not be an entire document you can feed a document into the parser incrementally via multiple calls to this function. Typically as you receive data from a network connection or file you feed each received chunk of data into this function aborting the process if an error occurs. Once an error is reported no further data may be fed to the GLib.MarkupParseContext all errors are fatal. \n"});
