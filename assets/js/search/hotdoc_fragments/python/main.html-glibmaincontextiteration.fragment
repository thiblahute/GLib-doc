fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#glibmaincontextiteration", "fragment": "GLib.MainContext.iteration \nRuns a single iteration for the given main loop. This involves checking to see if any event sources are ready to be processed then if no events sources are ready and may_block is True waiting for a source to become ready then dispatching the highest priority events sources that are ready. Otherwise if may_block is False sources are not waited to become ready only those highest priority events sources will be dispatched if any that are ready at this given moment without further waiting. \nNote that even when may_block is True it is still possible for GLib.MainContext.iteration to return False since the wait may be interrupted for other reasons than an event source becoming ready. \n"});
