The GLib.String structure itself is deallocated and it is therefore invalid to use string after invoking this function. \nNote that while GLib.String ensures that its buffer always has a trailing nul character not reflected in its len the returned GLib.Bytes does not include this extra nul i.e. it has length exactly equal to the len member. \n"});
