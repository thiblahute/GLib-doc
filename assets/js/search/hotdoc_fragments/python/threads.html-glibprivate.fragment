It is approximately equivalent to the pthread_setspecific pthread_getspecific APIs on POSIX and to TlsSetValue TlsGetValue on Windows. \nIf you don t already know why you might want this functionality then you probably don t need it. \nGLib.Private is a very limited resource as far as per program shared between all libraries It is also not possible to destroy a GLib.Private after it has been used. As such it is only ever acceptable to use GLib.Private in static scope and even then sparingly so. \nSee G_PRIVATE_INIT not introspectable for a couple of examples. \nThe GLib.Private structure should be considered opaque. It should only be accessed via the g_private_ functions. \n"});
