fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/threads.html#glibrwlockinit", "fragment": "GLib.RWLock.init \nInitializes a GLib.RWLock so that it can be used. \nThis function is useful to initialize a lock that has been allocated on the stack or as part of a larger structure. It is not necessary to initialise a reader writer lock that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of GLib.RWLock.init when a lock is no longer needed use GLib.RWLock.clear. \nCalling GLib.RWLock.init on an already initialized GLib.RWLock leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
