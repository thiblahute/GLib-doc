fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#glibsource_set_name_by_id", "fragment": "GLib.source_set_name_by_id \nSets the name of a source using its ID. \nThis is a convenience utility to set source names from the return value of g_idle_add not introspectable g_timeout_add not introspectable etc. \nIt is a programmer error to attempt to set the name of a non existent source. \nMore specifically source IDs can be reissued after a source has been destroyed and therefore it is never valid to use this function with a source ID which may have already been removed. An example is when scheduling an idle to run in another thread with g_idle_add not introspectable the idle may already have run and been removed by the time this function is called on its now invalid source ID. This source ID may have been reissued leading to the operation being performed against the wrong source. \n"});
