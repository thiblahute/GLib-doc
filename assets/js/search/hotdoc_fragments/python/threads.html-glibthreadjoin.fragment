If thread has already terminated then GLib.Thread.join returns immediately. \nAny thread can wait for any other thread by calling GLib.Thread.join not just its creator Calling GLib.Thread.join from multiple threads for the same thread leads to undefined behaviour. \nThe value returned by func or given to GLib.thread_exit is returned by this function. \nGLib.Thread.join consumes the reference to the passed in thread. This will usually cause the GLib.Thread struct and associated resources to be freed. Use GLib.Thread.ref to obtain an extra reference if you want to keep the GThread alive beyond the GLib.Thread.join call. \n"});
