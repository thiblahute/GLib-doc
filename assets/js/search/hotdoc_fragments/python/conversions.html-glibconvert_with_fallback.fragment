fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/conversions.html#glibconvert_with_fallback", "fragment": "GLib.convert_with_fallback \nConverts a string from one character set to another possibly including fallback sequences for characters not representable in the output. Note that it is not guaranteed that the specification for the fallback sequences in fallback will be honored. Some systems may do an approximate conversion from from_codeset to to_codeset in their iconv functions in which case GLib will simply return that approximate conversion. \nNote that you should use GLib.iconv for streaming conversions. Despite the fact that byes_read can return information about partial characters the g_convert_... functions are not generally suitable for streaming. If the underlying converter maintains internal state then this won t be preserved across successive calls to GLib.convert GLib.convert_with_iconv or GLib.convert_with_fallback. An example of this is the GNU C converter for CP1255 which does not emit a base character until it knows that the next character is not a mark that could combine with the base character. \n"});
