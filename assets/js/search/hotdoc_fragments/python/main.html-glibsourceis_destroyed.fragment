fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/main.html#glibsourceis_destroyed", "fragment": "GLib.Source.is_destroyed \nReturns whether source has been destroyed. \nThis is important when you operate upon your objects from within idle handlers but may have freed the object before the dispatch of your idle handler. \nThis will fail in a multi threaded application if the widget is destroyed before the idle handler fires due to the use after free in the callback. A solution to this particular problem is to check to if the source has already been destroy within the callback. \nCalls to this function from a thread other than the one acquired by the GLib.MainContext the GLib.Source is attached to are typically redundant as the source could be destroyed immediately after this function returns. However once a source is destroyed it cannot be un destroyed so this function can be used for opportunistic checks from any thread. \n"});
