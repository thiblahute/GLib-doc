fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gvariant.html#glibvariant_parse", "fragment": "GLib.variant_parse \nParses a GLib.Variant from a text representation. \nA single GLib.Variant is parsed from the content of text. \nThe format is described here gvariant text \nThe memory at limit will never be accessed and the parser behaves as if the character at limit is the nul terminator. This has the effect of bounding text. \nIf endptr is non NULL then text is permitted to contain data following the value that this function parses and endptr will be updated to point to the first character past the end of the text parsed by this function. If endptr is None and there is extra data then an error is returned. \nIf type is non NULL then the value will be parsed to have that type. This may result in additional parse errors in the case that the parsed value doesn t fit the type but may also result in fewer errors in the case that the type would have been ambiguous such as with empty arrays \nIn the event that the parsing is successful the resulting GLib.Variant is returned. It is never floating and must be freed with GLib.Variant.unref. \nIn case of any error None will be returned. If error is non NULL then it will be set to reflect the error that occurred. \nOfficially the language understood by the parser is any string produced by GLib.Variant.print \n"});
