Appends nul terminated src string to dest guaranteeing nul termination for dest. The total size of dest won t exceed dest_size. \nAt most dest_size characters will be copied. Unlike strncat dest_size is the full size of dest not the space left over. This function does not allocate memory. It always nul terminates unless dest_size or there were no nul characters in the dest_size characters of dest to start with \nCaveat this is supposedly a more secure alternative to strcat or strncat but for real security g_strconcat not introspectable is harder to mess up. \n"});
