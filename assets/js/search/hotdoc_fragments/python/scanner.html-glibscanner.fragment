If you are scanning a file the filename would be a good choice. \nThe user_data and max_parse_errors fields are not used. If you need to associate extra data with the scanner you can place them here. \nIf you want to use your own message handler you can set the msg_handler field. The type of the message handler function is declared by GLib.ScannerMsgFunc. \n"});
