However unlike these functions the template should only be a basename no directory components are allowed. If template is None a default template is used. \nNote that in contrast to GLib.mkstemp and mkstemp tmpl is not modified and might thus be a read only literal string. \nUpon success and if name_used is non NULL the actual name used is returned in name_used. This string should be freed with GLib.free when not needed any longer. The returned name is in the GLib file name encoding. \n"});
