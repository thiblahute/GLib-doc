fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/threads.html#glibthread", "fragment": "GLib.Thread \nThe GLib.Thread struct represents a running thread. This struct is returned by g_thread_new not introspectable or g_thread_try_new not introspectable You can obtain the GLib.Thread struct representing the current thread by calling GLib.thread_self. \nGThread is refcounted see GLib.Thread.ref and GLib.Thread.unref. The thread represented by it holds a reference while it is running and GLib.Thread.join consumes the reference that it is given so it is normally not necessary to manage GThread references explicitly. \nThe structure is opaque none of its fields may be directly accessed. \n"});
