fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gregex.html#glibregexmatch", "fragment": "GLib.Regex.match \nScans for a match in string for the pattern in regex. The match_options are combined with the match options specified when the regex structure was created letting you have more flexibility in reusing GLib.Regex structures. \nA GLib.MatchInfo structure used to get information on the match is stored in match_info if not None. Note that if match_info is not None then it is created even if the function returns False i.e. you must free it regardless if regular expression actually matched. \nTo retrieve all the non overlapping matches of the pattern in string you can use GLib.MatchInfo.next. \nstring is not copied and is used in GLib.MatchInfo internally. If you use any GLib.MatchInfo method except GLib.MatchInfo.free after freeing or modifying string then the behaviour is undefined. \n"});
