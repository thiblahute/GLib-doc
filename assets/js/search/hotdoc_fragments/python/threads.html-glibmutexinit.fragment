fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/threads.html#glibmutexinit", "fragment": "GLib.Mutex.init \nInitializes a GMutex so that it can be used. \nThis function is useful to initialize a mutex that has been allocated on the stack or as part of a larger structure. It is not necessary to initialize a mutex that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of GLib.Mutex.init when a mutex is no longer needed use GLib.Mutex.clear. \nCalling GLib.Mutex.init on an already initialized GMutex leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
