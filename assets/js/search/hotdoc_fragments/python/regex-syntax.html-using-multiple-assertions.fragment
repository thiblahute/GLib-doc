For example \nmatches foo preceded by three digits that are not Notice that each of the assertions is applied independently at the same point in the string. First there is a check that the previous three characters are all digits and then there is a check that the same three characters are not This pattern does not match foo preceded by six characters the first of which are digits and the last three of which are not For example it doesn t match abcfoo A pattern to do that is \nThis time the first assertion looks at the preceding six characters checking that the first three are digits and then the second assertion checks that the preceding three characters are not \nAssertions can be nested in any combination. For example \nmatches an occurrence of baz that is preceded by bar which in turn is not preceded by foo while \nis another pattern that matches foo preceded by three digits and any three characters that are not \n"});
