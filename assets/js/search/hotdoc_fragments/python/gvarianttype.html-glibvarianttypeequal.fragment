fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gvarianttype.html#glibvarianttypeequal", "fragment": "GLib.VariantType.equal \nCompares type1 and type2 for equality. \nOnly returns True if the types are exactly equal. Even if one type is an indefinite type and the other is a subtype of it False will be returned if they are not exactly equal. If you want to check for subtypes use GLib.VariantType.is_subtype_of. \nThe argument types of type1 and type2 are only gconstpointer to allow use with GLib.HashTable without function pointer casting. For both arguments a valid GLib.VariantType must be provided. \n"});
