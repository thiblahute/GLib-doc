The following are always recognized \nEach pair of escape sequences partitions the complete set of characters into two disjoint sets. Any given character matches one and only one of each pair. \nThese character type sequences can appear both inside and outside character classes. They each match one character of the appropriate type. If the current matching point is at the end of the passed string all of them fail since there is no character to match. \nFor compatibility with Perl s does not match the VT character code This makes it different from the POSIX space class. The s characters are HT LF FF CR and space \nA word character is an underscore or any character less than that is a letter or digit. \nCharacters with values greater than never match d s or w and always match D S and W. \n"});
