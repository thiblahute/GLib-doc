fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/option.html#gliboptioncontextparse_strv", "fragment": "GLib.OptionContext.parse_strv \nParses the command line arguments. \nThis function is similar to GLib.OptionContext.parse except that it respects the normal memory rules when dealing with a strv instead of assuming that the passed in array is the argv of the main function. \nIn particular strings that are removed from the arguments list will be freed using GLib.free. \nOn Windows the strings are expected to be in UTF This is in contrast to GLib.OptionContext.parse which expects them to be in the system codepage which is how they are passed as argv to main. See g_win32_get_command_line for a solution. \nThis function is useful if you are trying to use GLib.OptionContext with GApplication. \n"});
