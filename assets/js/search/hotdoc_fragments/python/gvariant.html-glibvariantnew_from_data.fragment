fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "python/gvariant.html#glibvariantnew_from_data", "fragment": "GLib.Variant.new_from_data \nCreates a new GLib.Variant instance from serialised data. \ntype is the type of GLib.Variant instance that will be constructed. The interpretation of data depends on knowing the type. \ndata is not modified by this function and must remain valid with an unchanging value until such a time as notify is called with user_data. If the contents of data change before that time then the result is undefined. \nIf data is trusted to be serialised data in normal form then trusted should be True. This applies to serialised data created within this process or read from a trusted location on the disk such as a file installed in usr lib alongside your application You should set trusted to False if data is read from the network a file in the user s home directory etc. \nIf data was not stored in this machine s native endianness any multi byte numeric values in the returned variant will also be in non native endianness. GLib.Variant.byteswap can be used to recover the original values. \nnotify will be called with user_data when data is no longer needed. The exact time of this call is unspecified and might even be before this function returns. \n"});
