fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/macros_misc.html#G_GNUC_BEGIN_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS", "fragment": "G_GNUC_BEGIN_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS \nTells gcc if it is a new enough version to temporarily stop emitting warnings when functions marked with G_GNUC_DEPRECATED or G_GNUC_DEPRECATED_FOR are called. This is useful for when you have one deprecated function calling another one or when you still have regression tests for deprecated functions. \nUse G_GNUC_END_IGNORE_DEPRECATIONS to begin warning again. If you are not compiling with Wdeprecated declarations then neither macro has any effect. \nThis macro can be used either inside or outside of a function body but must appear on a line by itself. \n"});
