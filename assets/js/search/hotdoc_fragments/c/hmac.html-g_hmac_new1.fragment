fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/hmac.html#g_hmac_new1", "fragment": "g_hmac_new \nCreates a new GHmac using the digest algorithm digest_type. If the digest_type is not known NULL is returned. A GHmac can be used to compute the HMAC of a key and an arbitrary binary blob using different hashing algorithms. \nA GHmac works by feeding a binary blob through g_hmac_update until the data is complete the digest can then be extracted using g_hmac_get_string which will return the checksum as a hexadecimal string or g_hmac_get_digest which will return a array of raw bytes. Once either g_hmac_get_string or g_hmac_get_digest have been called on a GHmac the HMAC will be closed and it won t be possible to call g_hmac_update on it anymore. \nSupport for digests of type G_CHECKSUM_SHA512 has been added in GLib Support for G_CHECKSUM_SHA384 was added in GLib \n"});
