fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/messages.html#g_error1", "fragment": "g_error \nA convenience function macro to log an error message. \nThis is not intended for end user error reporting. Use of GError is preferred for that instead as it allows calling functions to perform actions conditional on the type of error. \nError messages are always fatal resulting in a call to abort to terminate the application. This function will result in a core dump don t use it for errors you expect. Using this function indicates a bug in your program i.e. an assertion failure. \nIf g_log_default_handler is used as the log handler function a new line character will automatically be appended to and need not be entered manually. \nIf structured logging is enabled this will use g_log_structured otherwise it will use g_log.
