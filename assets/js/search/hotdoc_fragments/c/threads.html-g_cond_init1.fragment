fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_cond_init1", "fragment": "g_cond_init \nInitialises a GCond so that it can be used. \nThis function is useful to initialise a GCond that has been allocated as part of a larger structure. It is not necessary to initialise a GCond that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of g_cond_init when a GCond is no longer needed use g_cond_clear. \nCalling g_cond_init on an already initialised GCond leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
