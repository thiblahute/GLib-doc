If there are alternatives in the pattern they are tried. If all the alternatives match the empty string the entire match fails. For example if the pattern a b is applied to a string not beginning with a or b it matches the empty string at the start of the string. With this flag set this match is not valid so GRegex searches further into the string for occurrences of a or b \nG_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL \n"});
