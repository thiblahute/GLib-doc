fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_get_string1", "fragment": "g_variant_get_string \nReturns the string value of a GVariant instance with a string type. This includes the types G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH and G_VARIANT_TYPE_SIGNATURE. \nThe string will always be UTF encoded and will never be NULL. \nIf length is non NULL then the length of the string in bytes is returned there. For trusted values this information is already known. For untrusted values a strlen will be performed. \nIt is an error to call this function with a value of any type other than those three. \nThe return value remains valid as long as value exists. \n"});
