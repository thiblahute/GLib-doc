GLib is slightly more difficult to cross compile than many packages because much of GLib is about hiding differences between different systems. \nThese notes cover things specific to cross compiling GLib for general information about cross compilation see the autoconf info pages. \nGLib tries to detect as much information as possible about the target system by compiling and linking programs without actually running anything however some information GLib needs is not available this way. This information needs to be provided to the configure script via a cache file or by setting the cache variables in your environment. \nAs an example of using a cache file to cross compile for the MingW32 Win32 runtime environment on a Linux system create a file win32.cache with the following contents \nThen execute the following commands \nThe complete list of cache file variables follows. Most of these won t need to be set in most cases. \n"});
