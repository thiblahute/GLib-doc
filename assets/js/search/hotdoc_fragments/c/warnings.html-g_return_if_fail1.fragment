If the function returns a value use g_return_val_if_fail instead. \nIf expr evaluates to FALSE the current function should be considered to have undefined behaviour a programmer error The only correct solution to such an error is to change the module that is calling the current function so that it avoids this incorrect call. \nTo make this undefined behaviour visible if expr evaluates to FALSE the result is usually that a critical message is logged and the current function returns. \nIf G_DISABLE_CHECKS is defined then the check is not performed. You should therefore not depend on any side effects of expr. \n"});
