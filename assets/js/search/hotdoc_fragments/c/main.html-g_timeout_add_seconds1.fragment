fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/main.html#g_timeout_add_seconds1", "fragment": "g_timeout_add_seconds \nSets a function to be called at regular intervals with the default priority G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT. The function is called repeatedly until it returns FALSE at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and the function will not be called again. \nThis internally creates a main loop source using g_timeout_source_new_seconds and attaches it to the main loop context using g_source_attach. You can do these steps manually if you need greater control. Also see g_timeout_add_seconds_full. \nNote that the first call of the timer may not be precise for timeouts of one second. If you need finer precision and have such a timeout you may want to use g_timeout_add instead. \nSee memory management of sources mainloop memory management for details on how to handle the return value and memory management of data. \nThe interval given is in terms of monotonic time not wall clock time. See g_get_monotonic_time. \n"});
