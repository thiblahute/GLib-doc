However the test is assumed to use no fixture and test suites are automatically created on the fly and added to the root fixture based on the slash separated portions of testpath. The test_data argument will be passed as first argument to test_func. \nIf testpath includes the component subprocess anywhere in it the test will be skipped by default and only run if explicitly required via the p command line option or g_test_trap_subprocess. \n"});
