It is an error to give a value with an incompatible type. See the section on GVariant format strings gvariant format strings Please note that the syntax of the format string is very likely to be extended in the future. \nformat_string determines the C types that are used for unpacking the values and also determines if the values are copied or borrowed see the section on GVariant format strings gvariant format strings pointers \n"});
