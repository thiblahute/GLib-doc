Typically you will want to call g_spawn_close_pid in the callback function for the source. \nGLib supports only a single callback per process id. \nThis internally creates a main loop source using g_child_watch_source_new and attaches it to the main loop context using g_source_attach. You can do these steps manually if you need greater control. \n"});
