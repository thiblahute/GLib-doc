fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/unicode.html#g_utf8_casefold1", "fragment": "g_utf8_casefold \nConverts a string into a form that is independent of case. The result will not correspond to any particular case but can be compared for equality or ordered with the results of calling g_utf8_casefold on other strings. \nNote that calling g_utf8_casefold followed by g_utf8_collate is only an approximation to the correct linguistic case insensitive ordering though it is a fairly good one. Getting this exactly right would require a more sophisticated collation function that takes case sensitivity into account. GLib does not currently provide such a function. \n"});
