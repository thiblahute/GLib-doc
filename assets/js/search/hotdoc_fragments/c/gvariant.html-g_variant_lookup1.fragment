In the case that NULL would have been returned this function returns FALSE. Otherwise it unpacks the returned value and returns TRUE. \nformat_string determines the C types that are used for unpacking the values and also determines if the values are copied or borrowed see the section on GVariant format strings gvariant format strings pointers \nThis function is currently implemented with a linear scan. If you plan to do many lookups then GVariantDict may be more efficient. \n"});
