fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_new_array1", "fragment": "g_variant_new_array \nCreates a new GVariant array from children. \nchild_type must be non NULL if n_children is zero. Otherwise the child type is determined by inspecting the first element of the children array. If child_type is non NULL then it must be a definite type. \nThe items of the array are taken from the children array. No entry in the children array may be NULL. \nAll items in the array must have the same type which must be the same as child_type if given. \nIf the children are floating references see g_variant_ref_sink the new instance takes ownership of them as if via g_variant_ref_sink. \n"});
