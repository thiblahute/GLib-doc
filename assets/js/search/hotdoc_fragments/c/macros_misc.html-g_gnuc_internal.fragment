Note that static functions do not need to be marked as internal in this way. See the GNU C documentation for details. \nWhen using a compiler that supports the GNU C hidden visibility attribute this macro expands to attribute visibility hidden When using the Sun Studio compiler it expands to __hidden. \nNote that for portability the attribute should be placed before the function declaration. While GCC allows the macro after the declaration Sun Studio does not. \n"});
