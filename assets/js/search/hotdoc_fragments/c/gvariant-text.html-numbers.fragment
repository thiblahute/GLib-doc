fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant-text.html#numbers", "fragment": "Numbers \nNumbers are given by default as decimal values. Octal and hex values can be given in the usual way by prefixing with or x Note that GVariant considers bytes to be unsigned integers and will print them as a two digit hexidecimal number by default. \nFloating point numbers can also be given in the usual ways including scientific and hexidecimal notations. \nFor lack of additional information integers will be parsed as int32 values by default. If the number has a point or an e in it then it will be parsed as a double precision floating point number by default. If type information is available either explicitly or inferred then that type will be used instead. \nSome examples \nparses as the int32 value five. \nparses as a floating point value. \ne1 parses the same as the value above. \nuint64 parses seven as a uint64. See Type Annotations. \n"});
