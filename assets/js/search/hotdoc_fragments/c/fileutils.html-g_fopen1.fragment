fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/fileutils.html#g_fopen1", "fragment": "g_fopen \nA wrapper for the stdio fopen function. The fopen function opens a file and associates a new stream with it. \nBecause file descriptors are specific to the C library on Windows and a file descriptor is part of the FILE struct the FILE returned by this function makes sense only to functions in the same C library. Thus if the GLib using code uses a different C library than GLib does the FILE returned by this function cannot be passed to C library functions like fprintf or fread. \nSee your C library manual for more details about fopen. \n"});
