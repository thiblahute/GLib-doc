If a character is wide according to g_unichar_iswide then it is also reported wide with this function but the converse is not necessarily true. See the Unicode Standard Annex for details. \nIf a character passes the g_unichar_iswide test then it will also pass this test but not the other way around. Note that some characters may pass both this test and g_unichar_iszerowidth. \n"});
