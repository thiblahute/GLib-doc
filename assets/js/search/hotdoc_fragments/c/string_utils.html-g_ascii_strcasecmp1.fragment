fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/string_utils.html#g_ascii_strcasecmp1", "fragment": "g_ascii_strcasecmp \nCompare two strings ignoring the case of ASCII characters. \nUnlike the BSD strcasecmp function this only recognizes standard ASCII letters and ignores the locale treating all non ASCII bytes as if they are not letters. \nThis function should be used only on strings that are known to be in encodings where the bytes corresponding to ASCII letters always represent themselves. This includes UTF and the ISO charsets but not for instance double byte encodings like the Windows Codepage where the trailing bytes of double byte characters include all ASCII letters. If you compare two CP932 strings using this function you will get false matches. \nBoth s1 and s2 must be non NULL. \n"});
