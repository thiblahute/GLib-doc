All fields are sent to the journal but if a field has length zero indicating program specific data then only its key will be sent. \nThis is suitable for use as a GLogWriterFunc. \nIf GLib has been compiled without systemd support this function is still defined but will always return G_LOG_WRITER_UNHANDLED. \n"});
