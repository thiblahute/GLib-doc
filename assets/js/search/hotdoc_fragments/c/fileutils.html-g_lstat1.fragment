fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/fileutils.html#g_lstat1", "fragment": "g_lstat \nA wrapper for the POSIX lstat function. The lstat function is like stat except that in the case of symbolic links it returns information about the symbolic link itself and not the file that it refers to. If the system does not support symbolic links g_lstat is identical to g_stat. \nSee your C library manual for more details about lstat. \n"});
