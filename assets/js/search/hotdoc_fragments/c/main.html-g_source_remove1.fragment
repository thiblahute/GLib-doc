fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/main.html#g_source_remove1", "fragment": "g_source_remove \nRemoves the source with the given id from the default main context. \nThe id of a GSource is given by g_source_get_id or will be returned by the functions g_source_attach g_idle_add g_idle_add_full g_timeout_add g_timeout_add_full g_child_watch_add g_child_watch_add_full g_io_add_watch and g_io_add_watch_full. \nSee also g_source_destroy. You must use g_source_destroy for sources added to a non default main context. \nIt is a programmer error to attempt to remove a non existent source. \nMore specifically source IDs can be reissued after a source has been destroyed and therefore it is never valid to use this function with a source ID which may have already been removed. An example is when scheduling an idle to run in another thread with g_idle_add the idle may already have run and been removed by the time this function is called on its now invalid source ID. This source ID may have been reissued leading to the operation being performed against the wrong source. \n"});
