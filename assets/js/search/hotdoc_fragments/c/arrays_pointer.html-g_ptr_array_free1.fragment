If free_seg is TRUE it frees the memory block holding the elements as well. Pass FALSE if you want to free the GPtrArray wrapper but preserve the underlying array for use elsewhere. If the reference count of array is greater than one the GPtrArray wrapper is preserved but the size of array will be set to zero. \nIf array contents point to dynamically allocated memory they should be freed separately if free_seg is TRUE and no GDestroyNotify function has been set for array. \n"});
