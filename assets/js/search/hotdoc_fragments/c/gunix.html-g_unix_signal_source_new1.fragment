In GLib versions before only SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM can be monitored. In GLib SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 were added. In GLib SIGWINCH was added. \nNote that unlike the UNIX default all sources which have created a watch will be dispatched regardless of which underlying thread invoked g_unix_signal_source_new. \nFor example an effective use of this function is to handle SIGTERM cleanly flushing any outstanding files and then calling g_main_loop_quit It is not safe to do any of this a regular UNIX signal handler your handler may be invoked while malloc or another library function is running causing reentrancy if you attempt to use it from the handler. None of the GLib GObject API is safe against this kind of reentrancy. \nThe interaction of this source when combined with native UNIX functions like sigprocmask is not defined. \nThe source will not initially be associated with any GMainContext and must be added to one with g_source_attach before it will be executed. \n"});
