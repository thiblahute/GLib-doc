If free_segment is TRUE it frees the memory block holding the elements as well and also each element if array has a element_free_func set. Pass FALSE if you want to free the GArray wrapper but preserve the underlying array for use elsewhere. If the reference count of array is greater than one the GArray wrapper is preserved but the size of array will be set to zero. \nIf array elements contain dynamically allocated memory they should be freed separately. \n"});
