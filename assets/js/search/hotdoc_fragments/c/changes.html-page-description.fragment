This was necessary because some seeds would yield very bad pseudo random streams. Also the pseudo random integers generated by g_rand _int_range will have a slightly better equal distribution with the new version of GLib. \nFurther information can be found at the website of the Mersenne Twister random number generator at http www.math.keio.ac.jp matumoto emt.html. \nThe original seeding and generation algorithms as found in GLib x can be used instead of the new ones by setting the environment variable G_RANDOM_VERSION to the value of Use the GLib algorithms only if you have sequences of numbers generated with Glib that you need to reproduce exactly. \nThe event loop functionality GMain has extensively been revised to support multiple separate main loops in separate threads. All sources timeouts idle functions etc. are associated with a GMainContext. \nCompatibility functions exist so that most application code dealing with the main loop will continue to work. However code that creates new custom types of sources will require modification. \nThe main changes here are \nSources are now exposed as GSource rather than simply as numeric ids. \nNew types of sources are created by structure derivation from GSource so the source_data parameter to the GSource virtual functions has been replaced with a GSource \nSources are first created then later added to a specific GMainContext. \nDispatching has been modified so both the callback and data are passed in to the dispatch virtual function. \nTo go along with this change the vtable for GIOChannel has changed and add_watch has been replaced by create_watch \ng_list_foreach and g_slist_foreach have been changed so they are now safe against removal of the current item not the next item. \nIt s not recommended to mutate the list in the callback to these functions in any case. \nGDate now works in UTF not in the current locale. If you want to use it with the encoding of the locale you need to convert strings using g_locale_to_utf8 first. \ng_strsplit has been fixed to \ninclude trailing empty tokens rather than stripping them \nsplit into a maximum of max_tokens tokens rather than max_tokens \nCode depending on either of these bugs will need to be fixed. \nDeprecated functions that got removed g_set_error_handler g_set_warning_handler g_set_message_handler use g_log_set_handler instead. \n"});
