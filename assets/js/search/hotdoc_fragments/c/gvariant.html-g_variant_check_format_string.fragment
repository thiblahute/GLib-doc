fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_check_format_string", "fragment": "g_variant_check_format_string \nChecks if calling g_variant_get with format_string on value would be valid from a type compatibility standpoint. format_string is assumed to be a valid format string from a syntactic standpoint \nIf copy_only is TRUE then this function additionally checks that it would be safe to call g_variant_unref on value immediately after the call to g_variant_get without invalidating the result. This is only possible if deep copies are made ie there are no pointers to the data inside of the soon to be freed GVariant instance If this check fails then a g_critical is printed and FALSE is returned. \nThis function is meant to be used by functions that wish to provide varargs accessors to GVariant values of uncertain values eg g_variant_lookup or g_menu_model_get_item_attribute \n"});
