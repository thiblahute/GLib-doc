We d also appreciate reports of incomplete or misleading information in the GLib documentation file those against the docs component of the glib product in Bugzilla. \nDon t hesitate to file a bug report even if you think we may know about it already or aren t sure of the details. Just give us as much information as you have and if it s already fixed or has already been discussed we ll add a note to that effect in the report. \nThe bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests it s not only for bugs. We track all GLib development in Bugzilla so it s the way to be sure the GLib developers won t forget about an issue. \n"});
