fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/option.html#g_option_context_parse_strv1", "fragment": "g_option_context_parse_strv \nParses the command line arguments. \nThis function is similar to g_option_context_parse except that it respects the normal memory rules when dealing with a strv instead of assuming that the passed in array is the argv of the main function. \nIn particular strings that are removed from the arguments list will be freed using g_free. \nOn Windows the strings are expected to be in UTF This is in contrast to g_option_context_parse which expects them to be in the system codepage which is how they are passed as argv to main. See g_win32_get_command_line for a solution. \nThis function is useful if you are trying to use GOptionContext with GApplication. \n"});
