fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/main.html#g_source_add_poll1", "fragment": "g_source_add_poll \nAdds a file descriptor to the set of file descriptors polled for this source. This is usually combined with g_source_new to add an event source. The event source s check function will typically test the revents field in the GPollFD struct and return TRUE if events need to be processed. \nThis API is only intended to be used by implementations of GSource. Do not call this API on a GSource that you did not create. \nUsing this API forces the linear scanning of event sources on each main loop iteration. Newly written event sources should try to use g_source_add_unix_fd instead of this API. \n"});
