fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/option.html#g_option_remaining", "fragment": "G_OPTION_REMAINING \nIf a long option in the main group has this name it is not treated as a regular option. Instead it collects all non option arguments which would otherwise be left in argv. The option must be of type G_OPTION_ARG_CALLBACK G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY or G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME_ARRAY. \nUsing G_OPTION_REMAINING instead of simply scanning argv for leftover arguments has the advantage that GOption takes care of necessary encoding conversions for strings or filenames. \n"});
