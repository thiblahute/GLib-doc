fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/warnings.html#g_print1", "fragment": "g_print \nOutputs a formatted message via the print handler. The default print handler simply outputs the message to stdout without appending a trailing new line character. Typically format should end with its own new line character. \ng_print should not be used from within libraries for debugging messages since it may be redirected by applications to special purpose message windows or even files. Instead libraries should use g_log g_log_structured or the convenience macros g_message g_warning and g_error. \n"});
