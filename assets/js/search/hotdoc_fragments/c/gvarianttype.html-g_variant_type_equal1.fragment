fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvarianttype.html#g_variant_type_equal1", "fragment": "g_variant_type_equal \nCompares type1 and type2 for equality. \nOnly returns TRUE if the types are exactly equal. Even if one type is an indefinite type and the other is a subtype of it FALSE will be returned if they are not exactly equal. If you want to check for subtypes use g_variant_type_is_subtype_of. \nThe argument types of type1 and type2 are only gconstpointer to allow use with GHashTable without function pointer casting. For both arguments a valid GVariantType must be provided. \n"});
