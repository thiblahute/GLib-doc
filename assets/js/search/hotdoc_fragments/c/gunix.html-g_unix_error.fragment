fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gunix.html#g_unix_error", "fragment": "G_UNIX_ERROR \nError domain for API in the g_unix_ namespace. Note that there is no exported enumeration mapping errno. Instead all functions ensure that errno is relevant. The code for all G_UNIX_ERROR is always and the error message is always generated via g_strerror. \nIt is expected that most code will not look at errno from these APIs. Important cases where one would want to differentiate between errors are already covered by existing cross platform GLib API such as e.g. GFile wrapping ENOENT. However it is provided for completeness at least. \n"});
