Generally you would pass in the constants GLIB_MAJOR_VERSION GLIB_MINOR_VERSION GLIB_MICRO_VERSION as the three arguments to this function that produces a check that the library in use is compatible with the version of GLib the application or module was compiled against. \nCompatibility is defined by two things first the version of the running library is newer than the version required_major.required_minor. required_micro.
