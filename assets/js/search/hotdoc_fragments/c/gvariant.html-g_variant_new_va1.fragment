If endptr is non NULL then it is updated to point to the first character past the end of the format string. \napp is a pointer to a va_list. The arguments according to format_string are collected from this va_list and the list is left pointing to the argument following the last. \nNote that the arguments in app must be of the correct width for their types specified in format_string when collected into the va_list. See the GVariant varargs documentation gvariant varargs. \nThese two generalisations allow mixing of multiple calls to g_variant_new_va and g_variant_get_va within a single actual varargs call by the user. \nThe return value will be floating if it was a newly created GVariant instance for example if the format string was ii In the case that the format_string was r or a format starting with then the collected GVariant pointer will be returned unmodified without adding any additional references. \nIn order to behave correctly in all cases it is necessary for the calling function to g_variant_ref_sink the return result before returning control to the user that originally provided the pointer. At this point the caller will have their own full reference to the result. This can also be done by adding the result to a container or by passing it to another g_variant_new call. \n"});
