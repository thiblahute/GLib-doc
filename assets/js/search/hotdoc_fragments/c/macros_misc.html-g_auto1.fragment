The type must support this. \nThis feature is only supported on GCC and clang. This macro is not defined on other compilers and should not be used in programs that are intended to be portable to those compilers. \nThis is meant to be used with stack allocated structures and non pointer types. For the more commonly used pointer version see g_autoptr. \nThis macro can be used to avoid having to do explicit cleanups of local variables when exiting functions. It often vastly simplifies handling of error conditions removing the need for various tricks such as goto out or repeating of cleanup code. It is also helpful for non error cases. \nConsider the following example \nYou must initialize the variable in some way either by use of an initialiser or by ensuring that an _init function will be called on it unconditionally before it goes out of scope. \n"});
