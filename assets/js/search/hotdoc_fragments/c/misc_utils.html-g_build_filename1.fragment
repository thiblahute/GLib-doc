fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/misc_utils.html#g_build_filename1", "fragment": "g_build_filename \nCreates a filename from a series of elements using the correct separator for filenames. \nOn Unix this function behaves identically to g_build_path G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S first_element \nOn Windows it takes into account that either the backslash or slash can be used as separator in filenames but otherwise behaves as on UNIX. When file pathname separators need to be inserted the one that last previously occurred in the parameters reading from left to right is used. \nNo attempt is made to force the resulting filename to be an absolute path. If the first element is a relative path the result will be a relative path. \n"});
