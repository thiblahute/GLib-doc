fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/iochannels.html#g_io_channel_get_flags1", "fragment": "g_io_channel_get_flags \nGets the current flags for a GIOChannel including read only flags such as G_IO_FLAG_IS_READABLE. \nThe values of the flags G_IO_FLAG_IS_READABLE and G_IO_FLAG_IS_WRITABLE are cached for internal use by the channel when it is created. If they should change at some later point e.g. partial shutdown of a socket with the UNIX shutdown function the user should immediately call g_io_channel_get_flags to update the internal values of these flags. \n"});
