fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_iter_copy1", "fragment": "g_variant_iter_copy \nCreates a new heap allocated GVariantIter to iterate over the container that was being iterated over by iter. Iteration begins on the new iterator from the current position of the old iterator but the two copies are independent past that point. \nUse g_variant_iter_free to free the return value when you no longer need it. \nA reference is taken to the container that iter is iterating over and will be releated only when g_variant_iter_free is called. \n"});
