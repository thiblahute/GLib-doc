fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/macros_misc.html#g_gnuc_const", "fragment": "G_GNUC_CONST \nExpands to the GNU C const function attribute if the compiler is gcc. Declaring a function as const enables better optimization of calls to the function. A const function doesn t examine any values except its parameters and has no effects except its return value. \nPlace the attribute after the declaration just before the semicolon. \nSee the GNU C documentation for more details. \nA function that has pointer arguments and examines the data pointed to must not be declared const. Likewise a function that calls a non const function usually must not be const. It doesn t make sense for a const function to return void. \n"});
