fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/fileutils.html#g_open1", "fragment": "g_open \nA wrapper for the POSIX open function. The open function is used to convert a pathname into a file descriptor. \nOn POSIX systems file descriptors are implemented by the operating system. On Windows it s the C library that implements open and file descriptors. The actual Win32 API for opening files is quite different see MSDN documentation for CreateFile. The Win32 API uses file handles which are more randomish integers not small integers like file descriptors. \nBecause file descriptors are specific to the C library on Windows the file descriptor returned by this function makes sense only to functions in the same C library. Thus if the GLib using code uses a different C library than GLib does the file descriptor returned by this function cannot be passed to C library functions like write or read. \nSee your C library manual for more details about open. \n"});
