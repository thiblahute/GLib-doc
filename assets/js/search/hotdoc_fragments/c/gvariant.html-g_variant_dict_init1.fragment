fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_dict_init1", "fragment": "g_variant_dict_init \nInitialises a GVariantDict structure. \nIf from_asv is given it is used to initialise the dictionary. \nThis function completely ignores the previous contents of dict. On one hand this means that it is valid to pass in completely uninitialised memory. On the other hand this means that if you are initialising over top of an existing GVariantDict you need to first call g_variant_dict_clear in order to avoid leaking memory. \nYou must not call g_variant_dict_ref or g_variant_dict_unref on a GVariantDict that was initialised with this function. If you ever pass a reference to a GVariantDict outside of the control of your own code then you should assume that the person receiving that reference may try to use reference counting you should use g_variant_dict_new instead of this function. \n"});
