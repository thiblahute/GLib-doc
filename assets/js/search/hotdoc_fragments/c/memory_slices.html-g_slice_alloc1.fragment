The block adress handed out can be expected to be aligned to at least sizeof void though in general slices are sizeof void bytes aligned if a malloc fallback implementation is used instead the alignment may be reduced in a libc dependent fashion. Note that the underlying slice allocation mechanism can be changed with the G_SLICE always malloc G_SLICE environment variable. \n"});
