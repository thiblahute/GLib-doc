fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#struct-gthread", "fragment": "struct GThread \nThe GThread struct represents a running thread. This struct is returned by g_thread_new or g_thread_try_new. You can obtain the GThread struct representing the current thread by calling g_thread_self. \nGThread is refcounted see g_thread_ref and g_thread_unref. The thread represented by it holds a reference while it is running and g_thread_join consumes the reference that it is given so it is normally not necessary to manage GThread references explicitly. \nThe structure is opaque none of its fields may be directly accessed. \n"});
