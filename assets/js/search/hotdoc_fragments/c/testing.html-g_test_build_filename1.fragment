fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/testing.html#g_test_build_filename1", "fragment": "g_test_build_filename \nCreates the pathname to a data file that is required for a test. \nThis function is conceptually similar to g_build_filename except that the first argument has been replaced with a GTestFileType argument. \nThe data file should either have been distributed with the module containing the test G_TEST_DIST or built as part of the build system of that module G_TEST_BUILT \nIn order for this function to work in srcdir builddir situations the G_TEST_SRCDIR and G_TEST_BUILDDIR environment variables need to have been defined. As of this is done by the glib.mk included in GLib. Please ensure that your copy is up to date before using this function. \nIn case neither variable is set this function will fall back to using the dirname portion of argv possibly removing libs This allows for casual running of tests directly from the commandline in the srcdir builddir case and should also support running of installed tests assuming the data files have been installed in the same relative path as the test binary. \n"});
