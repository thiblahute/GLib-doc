The string has to be valid UTF otherwise NULL is returned. You should generally call g_utf8_normalize before comparing two Unicode strings. \nThe normalization mode G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT only standardizes differences that do not affect the text content such as the above mentioned accent representation. G_NORMALIZE_ALL also standardizes the compatibility characters in Unicode such as SUPERSCRIPT THREE to the standard forms in this case DIGIT THREE Formatting information may be lost but for most text operations such characters should be considered the same. \nG_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT_COMPOSE and G_NORMALIZE_ALL_COMPOSE are like G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT and G_NORMALIZE_ALL but returned a result with composed forms rather than a maximally decomposed form. This is often useful if you intend to convert the string to a legacy encoding or pass it to a system with less capable Unicode handling. \n"});
