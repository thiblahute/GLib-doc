A log entry is a collection of one or more GLogField using the standard field names from journal specification. See g_log_structured for more information. \nWriter functions must ignore fields which they do not recognise unless they can write arbitrary binary output as field values may be arbitrary binary. \nlog_level is guaranteed to be included in fields as the PRIORITY field but is provided separately for convenience of deciding whether or where to output the log entry. \n"});
