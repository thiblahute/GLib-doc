A fixture data structure with setup and teardown functions may be provided similar to g_test_create_case. \ng_test_add is implemented as a macro so that the fsetup ftest and fteardown callbacks can expect a Fixture pointer as their first argument in a type safe manner. They otherwise have type GTestFixtureFunc. \n"});
