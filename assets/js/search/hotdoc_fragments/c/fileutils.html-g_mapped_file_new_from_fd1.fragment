On UNIX this is using the mmap function. \nIf writable is TRUE the mapped buffer may be modified otherwise it is an error to modify the mapped buffer. Modifications to the buffer are not visible to other processes mapping the same file and are not written back to the file. \nNote that modifications of the underlying file might affect the contents of the GMappedFile. Therefore mapping should only be used if the file will not be modified or if all modifications of the file are done atomically e.g. using g_file_set_contents \n"});
