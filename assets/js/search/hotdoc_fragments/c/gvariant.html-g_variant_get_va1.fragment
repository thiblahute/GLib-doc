If endptr is non NULL then it is updated to point to the first character past the end of the format string. \napp is a pointer to a va_list. The arguments according to format_string are collected from this va_list and the list is left pointing to the argument following the last. \nThese two generalisations allow mixing of multiple calls to g_variant_new_va and g_variant_get_va within a single actual varargs call by the user. \nformat_string determines the C types that are used for unpacking the values and also determines if the values are copied or borrowed see the section on GVariant format strings gvariant format strings pointers \n"});
