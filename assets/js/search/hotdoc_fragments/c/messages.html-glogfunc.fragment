fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/messages.html#glogfunc", "fragment": "GLogFunc \nSpecifies the prototype of log handler functions. \nThe default log handler g_log_default_handler automatically appends a new line character to message when printing it. It is advised that any custom log handler functions behave similarly so that logging calls in user code do not need modifying to add a new line character to the message if the log handler is changed. \nThis is not used if structured logging is enabled see Using Structured Logging using structured logging \n"});
