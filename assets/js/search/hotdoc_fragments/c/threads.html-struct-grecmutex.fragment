fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#struct-grecmutex", "fragment": "struct GRecMutex \nThe GRecMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a recursive mutex. It is similar to a GMutex with the difference that it is possible to lock a GRecMutex multiple times in the same thread without deadlock. When doing so care has to be taken to unlock the recursive mutex as often as it has been locked. \nIf a GRecMutex is allocated in static storage then it can be used without initialisation. Otherwise you should call g_rec_mutex_init on it and g_rec_mutex_clear when done. \nA GRecMutex should only be accessed with the g_rec_mutex_ functions. \n"});
