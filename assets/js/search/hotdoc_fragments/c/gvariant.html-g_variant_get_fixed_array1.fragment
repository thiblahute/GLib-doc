Numeric types are fixed size as are tuples containing only other fixed sized types. \nelement_size must be the size of a single element in the array as given by the section on serialized data memory gvariant serialised data memory \nIn particular arrays of these fixed sized types can be interpreted as an array of the given C type with element_size set to the size the appropriate type \nFor example if calling this function for an array of bit integers you might say sizeof gint32 This value isn t used except for the purpose of a double check that the form of the serialised data matches the caller s expectation. \nn_elements which must be non NULL is set equal to the number of items in the array. \n"});
