These can be determined only on Windows or later and are not present in the list on other Windows versions. See documentation for CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA and CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS. \nThen follows the share subfolder in the installation folder for the package containing the DLL that calls this function if it can be determined. \nFinally the list contains the share subfolder in the installation folder for GLib and in the installation folder for the package the application s exe file belongs to. \nThe installation folders above are determined by looking up the folder where the module DLL or EXE in question is located. If the folder s name is bin its parent is used otherwise the folder itself. \nNote that on Windows the returned list can vary depending on where this function is called. \n"});
