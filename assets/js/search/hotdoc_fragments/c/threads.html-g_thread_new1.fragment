fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_thread_new1", "fragment": "g_thread_new \nThis function creates a new thread. The new thread starts by invoking func with the argument data. The thread will run until func returns or until g_thread_exit is called from the new thread. The return value of func becomes the return value of the thread which can be obtained with g_thread_join. \nThe name can be useful for discriminating threads in a debugger. It is not used for other purposes and does not have to be unique. Some systems restrict the length of name to bytes. \nIf the thread can not be created the program aborts. See g_thread_try_new if you want to attempt to deal with failures. \nIf you are using threads to offload potentially many short lived tasks GThreadPool may be more appropriate than manually spawning and tracking multiple GThread. \nTo free the struct returned by this function use g_thread_unref. Note that g_thread_join implicitly unrefs the GThread as well. \n"});
