fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_compare1", "fragment": "g_variant_compare \nCompares one and two. \nThe types of one and two are gconstpointer only to allow use of this function with GTree GPtrArray etc. They must each be a GVariant. \nComparison is only defined for basic types ie booleans numbers strings For booleans FALSE is less than TRUE. Numbers are ordered in the usual way. Strings are in ASCII lexographical order. \nIt is a programmer error to attempt to compare container values or two values that have types that are not exactly equal. For example you cannot compare a bit signed integer with a bit unsigned integer. Also note that this function is not particularly well behaved when it comes to comparison of doubles in particular the handling of incomparable values ie NaN is undefined. \nIf you only require an equality comparison g_variant_equal is more general. \n"});
