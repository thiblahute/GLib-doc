fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/date.html#g_date_strftime1", "fragment": "g_date_strftime \nGenerates a printed representation of the date in a locale setlocale specific way. Works just like the platform s C library strftime function but only accepts date related formats time related formats give undefined results. Date must be valid. Unlike strftime which uses the locale encoding works on a UTF format string and stores a UTF result. \nThis function does not provide any conversion specifiers in addition to those implemented by the platform s C library. For example don t expect that using g_date_strftime would make the F provided by the C99 strftime work on Windows where the C library only complies to C89. \n"});
