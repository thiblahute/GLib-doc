In the case that format simply specified the collection of a GVariant pointer eg format was then the collected GVariant pointer will be returned unmodified without adding any additional references. \nNote that the arguments in app must be of the correct width for their types specified in format when collected into the va_list. See the GVariant varargs documentation gvariant varargs \nIn order to behave correctly in all cases it is necessary for the calling function to g_variant_ref_sink the return result before returning control to the user that originally provided the pointer. At this point the caller will have their own full reference to the result. This can also be done by adding the result to a container or by passing it to another g_variant_new call. \n"});
