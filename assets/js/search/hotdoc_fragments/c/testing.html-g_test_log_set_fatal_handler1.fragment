So you install a handler that compares the domain and message to precisely not abort in such a case. \nNote that the handler is reset at the beginning of any test case so you have to set it inside each test function which needs the special behavior. \nThis handler has no effect on g_error messages. \nThis handler also has no effect on structured log messages using g_log_structured or g_log_structured_array To change the fatal behaviour for specific log messages programs must install a custom log writer function using g_log_set_writer_func.See Using Structured Logging using structured logging \n"});
