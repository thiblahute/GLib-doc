fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/iochannels.html#g_io_channel_set_encoding1", "fragment": "g_io_channel_set_encoding \nSets the encoding for the input output of the channel. The internal encoding is always UTF The default encoding for the external file is UTF \nThe encoding NULL is safe to use with binary data. \nThe encoding can only be set if one of the following conditions is true \nThe channel was just created and has not been written to or read from yet. \nThe channel is write only. \nThe channel is a file and the file pointer was just repositioned by a call to g_io_channel_seek_position. This flushes all the internal buffers. \nThe current encoding is NULL or UTF \nOne of the new API read functions has just returned G_IO_STATUS_EOF or in the case of g_io_channel_read_to_end G_IO_STATUS_NORMAL \nOne of the functions g_io_channel_read_chars or g_io_channel_read_unichar has returned G_IO_STATUS_AGAIN or G_IO_STATUS_ERROR. This may be useful in the case of G_CONVERT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_SEQUENCE. Returning one of these statuses from g_io_channel_read_line g_io_channel_read_line_string or g_io_channel_read_to_end does not guarantee that the encoding can be changed. \nChannels which do not meet one of the above conditions cannot call g_io_channel_seek_position with an offset of G_SEEK_CUR and if they are seekable cannot call g_io_channel_write_chars after calling one of the API read functions. \nReturn Value G_IO_STATUS_NORMAL if the encoding was successfully set \n"});
