If the start_position argument to the matching functions is non zero circumflex can never match if the G_REGEX_MULTILINE option is unset. Inside a character class circumflex has an entirely different meaning see below \nCircumflex need not be the first character of the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved but it should be the first thing in each alternative in which it appears if the pattern is ever to match that branch. If all possible alternatives start with a circumflex that is if the pattern is constrained to match only at the start of the string it is said to be an anchored pattern. There are also other constructs that can cause a pattern to be anchored. \nA dollar character is an assertion that is true only if the current matching point is at the end of the string or immediately before a newline at the end of the string by default Dollar need not be the last character of the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved but it should be the last item in any branch in which it appears. Dollar has no special meaning in a character class. \nThe meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches only at the very end of the string by setting the G_REGEX_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option at compile time. This does not affect the Z assertion. \nThe meanings of the circumflex and dollar characters are changed if the G_REGEX_MULTILINE option is set. When this is the case a circumflex matches immediately after internal newlines as well as at the start of the string. It does not match after a newline that ends the string. A dollar matches before any newlines in the string as well as at the very end when G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set. When newline is specified as the two character sequence CRLF isolated CR and LF characters do not indicate newlines. \nFor example the pattern abc matches the string def nabc where n represents a newline in multiline mode but not otherwise. Consequently patterns that are anchored in single line mode because all branches start with are not anchored in multiline mode and a match for circumflex is possible when the start_position argument of a matching function is non zero. The G_REGEX_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option is ignored if G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set. \nNote that the sequences A Z and z can be used to match the start and end of the string in both modes and if all branches of a pattern start with A it is always anchored whether or not G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set. \n"});
