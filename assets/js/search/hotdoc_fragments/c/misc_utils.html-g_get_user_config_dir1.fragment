fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/misc_utils.html#g_get_user_config_dir1", "fragment": "g_get_user_config_dir \nReturns a base directory in which to store user specific application configuration information such as user preferences and settings. \nOn UNIX platforms this is determined using the mechanisms described in the XDG Base Directory Specification. In this case the directory retrieved will be XDG_CONFIG_HOME. \nOn Windows this is the folder to use for local as opposed to roaming application data. See documentation for CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA. Note that on Windows it thus is the same as what g_get_user_data_dir returns. \n"});
