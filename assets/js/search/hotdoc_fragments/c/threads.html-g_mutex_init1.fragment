fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_mutex_init1", "fragment": "g_mutex_init \nInitializes a GMutex so that it can be used. \nThis function is useful to initialize a mutex that has been allocated on the stack or as part of a larger structure. It is not necessary to initialize a mutex that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of g_mutex_init when a mutex is no longer needed use g_mutex_clear. \nCalling g_mutex_init on an already initialized GMutex leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
