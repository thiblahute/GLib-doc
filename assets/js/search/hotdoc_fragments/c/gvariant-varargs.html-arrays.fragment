As a special exception if the given type string is a definite type then NULL may be given to mean an empty array of that type. \nUpon encountering an a character followed by a type string g_variant_get will take a pointer to a GVariantIter ie GVariantIter A new heap allocated iterator is created and returned initialised for iterating over the elements of the array. This iterator should be freed when you are done with it using g_variant_iter_free NULL may also be given to indicate that the value of the array should be ignored. \n"});
