fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/main.html#g_child_watch_source_new1", "fragment": "g_child_watch_source_new \nCreates a new child_watch source. \nThe source will not initially be associated with any GMainContext and must be added to one with g_source_attach before it will be executed. \nNote that child watch sources can only be used in conjunction with g_spawn... when the G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag is used. \nNote that on platforms where GPid must be explicitly closed see g_spawn_close_pid pid must not be closed while the source is still active. Typically you will want to call g_spawn_close_pid in the callback function for the source. \nNote further that using g_child_watch_source_new is not compatible with calling waitpid with a nonpositive first argument in the application. Calling waitpid for individual pids will still work fine. \nSimilarly on POSIX platforms the pid passed to this function must be greater than i.e. this function must wait for a specific child and cannot wait for one of many children by using a nonpositive argument \n"});
