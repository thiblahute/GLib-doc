fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/unicode.html#g_unichar_fully_decompose1", "fragment": "g_unichar_fully_decompose \nComputes the canonical or compatibility decomposition of a Unicode character. For compatibility decomposition pass TRUE for compat for canonical decomposition pass FALSE for compat. \nThe decomposed sequence is placed in result. Only up to result_len characters are written into result. The length of the full decomposition irrespective of result_len is returned by the function. For canonical decomposition currently all decompositions are of length at most but this may change in the future very unlikely though At any rate Unicode does guarantee that a buffer of length is always enough for both compatibility and canonical decompositions so that is the size recommended. This is provided as G_UNICHAR_MAX_DECOMPOSITION_LENGTH. \nSee UAX for details. \n"});
