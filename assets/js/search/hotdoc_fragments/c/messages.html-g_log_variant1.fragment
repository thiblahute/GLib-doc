This version is especially useful for use in other languages via introspection. \nThe only mandatory item in the fields dictionary is the MESSAGE which must contain the text shown to the user. \nThe values in the fields dictionary are likely to be of type String G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING Array of bytes G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTESTRING is also supported. In this case the message is handled as binary and will be forwarded to the log writer as such. The size of the array should not be higher than G_MAXSSIZE. Otherwise it will be truncated to this size. For other types g_variant_print will be used to convert the value into a string. \nFor more details on its usage and about the parameters see g_log_structured. \n"});
