fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_dict_new1", "fragment": "g_variant_dict_new \nAllocates and initialises a new GVariantDict. \nYou should call g_variant_dict_unref on the return value when it is no longer needed. The memory will not be automatically freed by any other call. \nIn some cases it may be easier to place a GVariantDict directly on the stack of the calling function and initialise it with g_variant_dict_init. This is particularly useful when you are using GVariantDict to construct a GVariant. \n"});
