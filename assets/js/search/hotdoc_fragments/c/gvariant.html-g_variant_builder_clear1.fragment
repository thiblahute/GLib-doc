fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_builder_clear1", "fragment": "g_variant_builder_clear \nReleases all memory associated with a GVariantBuilder without freeing the GVariantBuilder structure itself. \nIt typically only makes sense to do this on a stack allocated GVariantBuilder if you want to abort building the value part way through. This function need not be called if you call g_variant_builder_end and it also doesn t need to be called on builders allocated with g_variant_builder_new see g_variant_builder_unref for that \nThis function leaves the GVariantBuilder structure set to all zeros. It is valid to call this function on either an initialised GVariantBuilder or one that is set to all zeros but it is not valid to call this function on uninitialised memory. \n"});
