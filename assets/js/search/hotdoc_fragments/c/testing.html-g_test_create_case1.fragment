When this test is executed a fixture structure of size data_size will be automatically allocated and filled with zeros. Then data_setup is called to initialize the fixture. After fixture setup the actual test function data_test is called. Once the test run completes the fixture structure is torn down by calling data_teardown and after that the memory is automatically released by the test framework. \nSplitting up a test run into fixture setup test function and fixture teardown is most useful if the same fixture is used for multiple tests. In this cases g_test_create_case will be called with the same fixture but varying test_name and data_test arguments. \n"});
