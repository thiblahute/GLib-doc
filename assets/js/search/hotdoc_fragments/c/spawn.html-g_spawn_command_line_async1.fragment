fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/spawn.html#g_spawn_command_line_async1", "fragment": "g_spawn_command_line_async \nA simple version of g_spawn_async that parses a command line with g_shell_parse_argv and passes it to g_spawn_async. Runs a command line in the background. Unlike g_spawn_async the G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag is enabled other flags are not. Note that G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH can have security implications so consider using g_spawn_async directly if appropriate. Possible errors are those from g_shell_parse_argv and g_spawn_async. \nThe same concerns on Windows apply as for g_spawn_command_line_sync. \n"});
