GNU gettext uses the character to separate the message context and message id in msgctxtid. \nThis uses g_dgettext internally. See that functions for differences with dgettext proper. \nThis function differs from C_ in that it is not a macro and thus you may use non string literals as context and msgid arguments. \n"});
