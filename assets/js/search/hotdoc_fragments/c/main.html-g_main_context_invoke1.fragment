Otherwise if context is the thread default main context of the current thread and g_main_context_acquire succeeds then function is called and g_main_context_release is called afterwards. \nIn any other case an idle source is created to call function and that source is attached to context presumably to be run in another thread The idle source is attached with G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT priority. If you want a different priority use g_main_context_invoke_full. \nNote that as with normal idle functions function should probably return FALSE. If it returns TRUE it will be continuously run in a loop and may prevent this call from returning \n"});
