fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/messages.html#g_warning1", "fragment": "g_warning \nA convenience function macro to log a warning message. \nThis is not intended for end user error reporting. Use of GError is preferred for that instead as it allows calling functions to perform actions conditional on the type of error. \nYou can make warnings fatal at runtime by setting the G_DEBUG environment variable see Running GLib Applications \nIf g_log_default_handler is used as the log handler function a newline character will automatically be appended to and need not be entered manually. \nIf structured logging is enabled this will use g_log_structured otherwise it will use g_log.
