fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/main.html#g_source_get_time1", "fragment": "g_source_get_time \nGets the time to be used when checking this source. The advantage of calling this function over calling g_get_monotonic_time directly is that when checking multiple sources GLib can cache a single value instead of having to repeatedly get the system monotonic time. \nThe time here is the system monotonic time if available or some other reasonable alternative otherwise. See g_get_monotonic_time. \n"});
