See also G_GINT16_FORMAT. \nSome platforms do not support scanning and printing bit integers even though the types are supported. On such platforms G_GUINT64_FORMAT is not defined. Note that scanf may not support bit integers even if G_GINT64_FORMAT is defined. Due to its weak error handling scanf is not recommended for parsing anyway consider using g_ascii_strtoull instead. \n"});
