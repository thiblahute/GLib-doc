fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/sequence.html#g_sequence_search1", "fragment": "g_sequence_search \nReturns an iterator pointing to the position where data would be inserted according to cmp_func and cmp_data. \ncmp_func is called with two items of the seq and user_data. It should return if the items are equal a negative value if the first item comes before the second and a positive value if the second item comes before the first. \nIf you are simply searching for an existing element of the sequence consider using g_sequence_lookup. \nThis function will fail if the data contained in the sequence is unsorted. Use g_sequence_insert_sorted or g_sequence_insert_sorted_iter to add data to your sequence or if you want to add a large amount of data call g_sequence_sort after doing unsorted insertions. \n"});
