fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/checksum.html#g_checksum_new1", "fragment": "g_checksum_new \nCreates a new GChecksum using the checksum algorithm checksum_type. If the checksum_type is not known NULL is returned. A GChecksum can be used to compute the checksum or digest of an arbitrary binary blob using different hashing algorithms. \nA GChecksum works by feeding a binary blob through g_checksum_update until there is data to be checked the digest can then be extracted using g_checksum_get_string which will return the checksum as a hexadecimal string or g_checksum_get_digest which will return a vector of raw bytes. Once either g_checksum_get_string or g_checksum_get_digest have been called on a GChecksum the checksum will be closed and it won t be possible to call g_checksum_update on it anymore. \n"});
