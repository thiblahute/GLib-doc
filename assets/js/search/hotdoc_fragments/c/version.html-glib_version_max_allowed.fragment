The definition should be one of the predefined GLib version macros GLIB_VERSION_2_26 GLIB_VERSION_2_28 \nThis macro defines the latest version of the GLib API that the package is allowed to make use of. \nIf the compiler is configured to warn about the use of deprecated functions then using functions added after version GLIB_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED will cause warnings. \nUnless you are using GLIB_CHECK_VERSION or the like to compile different code depending on the GLib version then this should be set to the same value as GLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED. \n"});
