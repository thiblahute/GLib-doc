fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/string_chunks.html#g_string_chunk_insert_const1", "fragment": "g_string_chunk_insert_const \nAdds a copy of string to the GStringChunk unless the same string has already been added to the GStringChunk with g_string_chunk_insert_const. \nThis function is useful if you need to copy a large number of strings but do not want to waste space storing duplicates. But you must remember that there may be several pointers to the same string and so any changes made to the strings should be done very carefully. \nNote that g_string_chunk_insert_const will not return a pointer to a string added with g_string_chunk_insert even if they do match. \n"});
