fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/quarks.html#g_quark_from_static_string1", "fragment": "g_quark_from_static_string \nGets the GQuark identifying the given static string. If the string does not currently have an associated GQuark a new GQuark is created linked to the given string. \nNote that this function is identical to g_quark_from_string except that if a new GQuark is created the string itself is used rather than a copy. This saves memory but can only be used if the string will continue to exist until the program terminates. It can be used with statically allocated strings in the main program but not with statically allocated memory in dynamically loaded modules if you expect to ever unload the module again e.g. do not use this function in GTK theme engines \n"});
