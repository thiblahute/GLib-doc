See g_test_trap_subprocess. \nThis is sometimes used to test situations that are formally considered to be undefined behaviour like inputs that fail a g_return_if_fail check. In these situations you should skip the entire test including the call to g_test_trap_subprocess unless g_test_undefined returns TRUE to indicate that undefined behaviour may be tested. \n"});
