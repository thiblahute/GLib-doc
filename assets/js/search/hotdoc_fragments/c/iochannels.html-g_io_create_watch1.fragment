For example if condition is G_IO_IN the source will be dispatched when there s data available for reading. \ng_io_add_watch is a simpler interface to this same functionality for the case where you want to add the source to the default main loop context at the default priority. \nOn Windows polling a GSource created to watch a channel for a socket puts the socket in non blocking mode. This is a side effect of the implementation and unavoidable. \n"});
