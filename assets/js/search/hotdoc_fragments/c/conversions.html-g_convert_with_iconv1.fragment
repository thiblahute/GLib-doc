Despite the fact that byes_read can return information about partial characters the g_convert_... functions are not generally suitable for streaming. If the underlying converter maintains internal state then this won t be preserved across successive calls to g_convert g_convert_with_iconv or g_convert_with_fallback. An example of this is the GNU C converter for CP1255 which does not emit a base character until it knows that the next character is not a mark that could combine with the base character. \n"});
