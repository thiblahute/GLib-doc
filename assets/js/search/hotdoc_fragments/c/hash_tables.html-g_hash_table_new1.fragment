The g_direct_hash g_int_hash g_int64_hash g_double_hash and g_str_hash functions are provided for some common types of keys. If hash_func is NULL g_direct_hash is used. \nkey_equal_func is used when looking up keys in the GHashTable. The g_direct_equal g_int_equal g_int64_equal g_double_equal and g_str_equal functions are provided for the most common types of keys. If key_equal_func is NULL keys are compared directly in a similar fashion to g_direct_equal but without the overhead of a function call. key_equal_func is called with the key from the hash table as its first parameter and the user provided key to check against as its second. \n"});
