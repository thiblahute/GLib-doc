The meaning of time_ depends on type. \nIf type is G_TIME_TYPE_UNIVERSAL then this function will always succeed since universal time is monotonic and continuous \nOtherwise time_ is treated as local time. The distinction between G_TIME_TYPE_STANDARD and G_TIME_TYPE_DAYLIGHT is ignored except in the case that the given time_ is ambiguous. In Toronto for example on November th occurred twice once inside of daylight savings time and the next an hour later outside of daylight savings time In this case the different value of type would result in a different interval being returned. \nIt is still possible for this function to fail. In Toronto for example on March th does not exist due to the leap forward to begin daylight savings time is returned in that case. \n"});
