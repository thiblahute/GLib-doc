Can only be called after g_hash_table_iter_next returned TRUE and cannot be called more than once for the same key value pair. \nIf the GHashTable was created using g_hash_table_new_full the key and value are freed using the supplied destroy functions otherwise you have to make sure that any dynamically allocated values are freed yourself. \nIt is safe to continue iterating the GHashTable afterward \n"});
