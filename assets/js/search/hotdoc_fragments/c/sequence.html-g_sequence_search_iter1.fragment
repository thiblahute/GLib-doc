It should return if the iterators are equal a negative value if the first iterator comes before the second and a positive value if the second iterator comes before the first. \nIf you are simply searching for an existing element of the sequence consider using g_sequence_lookup_iter. \nThis function will fail if the data contained in the sequence is unsorted. Use g_sequence_insert_sorted or g_sequence_insert_sorted_iter to add data to your sequence or if you want to add a large amount of data call g_sequence_sort after doing unsorted insertions. \n"});
