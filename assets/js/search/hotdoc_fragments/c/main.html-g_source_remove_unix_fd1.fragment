fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/main.html#g_source_remove_unix_fd1", "fragment": "g_source_remove_unix_fd \nReverses the effect of a previous call to g_source_add_unix_fd. \nYou only need to call this if you want to remove an fd from being watched while keeping the same source around. In the normal case you will just want to destroy the source. \nThis API is only intended to be used by implementations of GSource. Do not call this API on a GSource that you did not create. \nAs the name suggests this function is not available on Windows. \n"});
