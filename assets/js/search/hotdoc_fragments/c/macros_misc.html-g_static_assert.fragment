fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/macros_misc.html#g_static_assert", "fragment": "G_STATIC_ASSERT \nThe G_STATIC_ASSERT macro lets the programmer check a condition at compile time the condition needs to be compile time computable. The macro can be used in any place where a typedef is valid. \nA typedef is generally allowed in exactly the same places that a variable declaration is allowed. For this reason you should not use G_STATIC_ASSERT in the middle of blocks of code. \nThe macro should only be used once per source code line. \n"});
