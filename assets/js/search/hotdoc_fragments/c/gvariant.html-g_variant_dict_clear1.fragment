fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_dict_clear1", "fragment": "g_variant_dict_clear \nReleases all memory associated with a GVariantDict without freeing the GVariantDict structure itself. \nIt typically only makes sense to do this on a stack allocated GVariantDict if you want to abort building the value part way through. This function need not be called if you call g_variant_dict_end and it also doesn t need to be called on dicts allocated with g_variant_dict_new see g_variant_dict_unref for that \nIt is valid to call this function on either an initialised GVariantDict or one that was previously cleared by an earlier call to g_variant_dict_clear but it is not valid to call this function on uninitialised memory. \n"});
