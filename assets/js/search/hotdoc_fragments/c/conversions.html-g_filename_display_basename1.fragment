fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/conversions.html#g_filename_display_basename1", "fragment": "g_filename_display_basename \nReturns the display basename for the particular filename guaranteed to be valid UTF The display name might not be identical to the filename for instance there might be problems converting it to UTF and some files can be translated in the display. \nIf GLib cannot make sense of the encoding of filename as a last resort it replaces unknown characters with U FFFD the Unicode replacement character. You can search the result for the UTF encoding of this character which is in octal notation to find out if filename was in an invalid encoding. \nYou must pass the whole absolute pathname to this functions so that translation of well known locations can be done. \nThis function is preferred over g_filename_display_name if you know the whole path as it allows translation. \n"});
