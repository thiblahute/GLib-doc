The first character set from the charsets is the filename encoding the subsequent character sets are used when trying to generate a displayable representation of a filename see g_filename_display_name. \nOn Unix the character sets are determined by consulting the environment variables G_FILENAME_ENCODING and G_BROKEN_FILENAMES. On Windows the character set used in the GLib API is always UTF and said environment variables have no effect. \nG_FILENAME_ENCODING may be set to a comma separated list of character set names. The special token locale is taken to mean the character set for the current locale setlocale If G_FILENAME_ENCODING is not set but G_BROKEN_FILENAMES is the character set of the current locale is taken as the filename encoding. If neither environment variable is set UTF is taken as the filename encoding but the character set of the current locale is also put in the list of encodings. \nThe returned charsets belong to GLib and must not be freed. \nNote that on Unix regardless of the locale character set or G_FILENAME_ENCODING value the actual file names present on a system might be in any random encoding or just gibberish. \n"});
