fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/fileutils.html#g_chmod1", "fragment": "g_chmod \nA wrapper for the POSIX chmod function. The chmod function is used to set the permissions of a file system object. \nOn Windows the file protection mechanism is not at all POSIX like and the underlying chmod function in the C library just sets or clears the FAT style READONLY attribute. It does not touch any ACL. Software that needs to manage file permissions on Windows exactly should use the Win32 API. \nSee your C library manual for more details about chmod. \n"});
