fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/arrays_pointer.html#g_ptr_array_remove_fast1", "fragment": "g_ptr_array_remove_fast \nRemoves the first occurrence of the given pointer from the pointer array. The last element in the array is used to fill in the space so this function does not preserve the order of the array. But it is faster than g_ptr_array_remove. If array has a non NULL GDestroyNotify function it is called for the removed element. \nIt returns TRUE if the pointer was removed or FALSE if the pointer was not found. \n"});
