A token is the possibly empty longest string that does not contain any of the characters in delimiters. If max_tokens is reached the remainder is appended to the last token. \nFor example the result of g_strsplit_set abc def ghi is a NULL terminated vector containing the three strings abc def and ghi \nThe result of g_strsplit_set def ghi is a NULL terminated vector containing the four strings def ghi and \nAs a special case the result of splitting the empty string is an empty vector not a vector containing a single string. The reason for this special case is that being able to represent a empty vector is typically more useful than consistent handling of empty elements. If you do need to represent empty elements you ll need to check for the empty string before calling g_strsplit_set. \nNote that this function works on bytes not characters so it can t be used to delimit UTF strings for anything but ASCII characters. \n"});
