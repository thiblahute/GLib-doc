The first difference is that must only use this function from within a testcase function. The second difference is that you need not free the return value it will be automatically freed when the testcase finishes running. \nIt is safe to use this function from a thread inside of a testcase but you must ensure that all such uses occur before the main testcase function returns ie it is best to ensure that all threads have been joined \n"});
