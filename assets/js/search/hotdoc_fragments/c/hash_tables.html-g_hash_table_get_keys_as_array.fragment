fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/hash_tables.html#g_hash_table_get_keys_as_array", "fragment": "g_hash_table_get_keys_as_array \nRetrieves every key inside hash_table as an array. \nThe returned array is NULL terminated but may contain NULL as a key. Use length to determine the true length if it s possible that NULL was used as the value for a key. \nNote in the common case of a string keyed GHashTable the return value of this function can be conveniently cast to const gchar \nThis iterates over every entry in the hash table to build its return value. To iterate over the entries in a GHashTable more efficiently use a GHashTableIter. \nYou should always free the return result with g_free. In the above mentioned case of a string keyed hash table it may be appropriate to use g_strfreev if you call g_hash_table_steal_all first to transfer ownership of the keys. \n"});
