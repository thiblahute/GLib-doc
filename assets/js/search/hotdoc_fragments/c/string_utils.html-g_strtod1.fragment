fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/string_utils.html#g_strtod1", "fragment": "g_strtod \nConverts a string to a gdouble value. It calls the standard strtod function to handle the conversion but if the string is not completely converted it attempts the conversion again with g_ascii_strtod and returns the best match. \nThis function should seldom be used. The normal situation when reading numbers not for human consumption is to use g_ascii_strtod. Only when you know that you must expect both locale formatted and C formatted numbers should you use this. Make sure that you don t pass strings such as comma separated lists of values since the commas may be interpreted as a decimal point in some locales causing unexpected results. \n"});
