At the boundary between two elements any trailing occurrences of separator in the first element or leading occurrences of separator in the second element are removed and exactly one copy of the separator is inserted. \nEmpty elements are ignored. \nThe number of leading copies of the separator on the result is the same as the number of leading copies of the separator on the first non empty element. \nThe number of trailing copies of the separator on the result is the same as the number of trailing copies of the separator on the last non empty element. Determination of the number of trailing copies is done without stripping leading copies so if the separator is ABA then ABABA has trailing copy. \nHowever if there is only a single non empty element and there are no characters in that element not part of the leading or trailing separators then the result is exactly the original value of that element. \nOther than for determination of the number of leading and trailing copies of the separator elements consisting only of copies of the separator are ignored. \n"});
