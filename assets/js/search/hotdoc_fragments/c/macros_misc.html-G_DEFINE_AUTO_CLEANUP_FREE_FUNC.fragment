It is used with pointer based typedefs and non pointer types where the value of the variable represents a resource that must be freed. Two examples are GStrv and file descriptors. \nnone specifies the none value for the type in question. It is probably something like NULL or If the variable is found to contain this value then the free function will not be called. \nThis macro should be used unconditionally it is a no op on compilers where cleanup is not supported. \n"});
