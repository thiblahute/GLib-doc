fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/thread_pools.html#g_thread_pool_new1", "fragment": "g_thread_pool_new \nThis function creates a new thread pool. \nWhenever you call g_thread_pool_push either a new thread is created or an unused one is reused. At most max_threads threads are running concurrently for this thread pool. max_threads allows unlimited threads to be created for this thread pool. The newly created or reused thread now executes the function func with the two arguments. The first one is the parameter to g_thread_pool_push and the second one is user_data. \nThe parameter exclusive determines whether the thread pool owns all threads exclusive or shares them with other thread pools. If exclusive is TRUE max_threads threads are started immediately and they will run exclusively for this thread pool until it is destroyed by g_thread_pool_free. If exclusive is FALSE threads are created when needed and shared between all non exclusive thread pools. This implies that max_threads may not be for exclusive thread pools. Besides exclusive thread pools are not affected by g_thread_pool_set_max_idle_time since their threads are never considered idle and returned to the global pool. \nerror can be NULL to ignore errors or non NULL to report errors. An error can only occur when exclusive is set to TRUE and not all max_threads threads could be created. See GThreadError for possible errors that may occur. Note even in case of error a valid GThreadPool is returned. \n"});
