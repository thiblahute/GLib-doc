fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_rw_lock_init1", "fragment": "g_rw_lock_init \nInitializes a GRWLock so that it can be used. \nThis function is useful to initialize a lock that has been allocated on the stack or as part of a larger structure. It is not necessary to initialise a reader writer lock that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of g_rw_lock_init when a lock is no longer needed use g_rw_lock_clear. \nCalling g_rw_lock_init on an already initialized GRWLock leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
