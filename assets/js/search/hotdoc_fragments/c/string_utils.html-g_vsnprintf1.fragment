fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/string_utils.html#g_vsnprintf1", "fragment": "g_vsnprintf \nA safer form of the standard vsprintf function. The output is guaranteed to not exceed n characters including the terminating nul character so it is easy to ensure that a buffer overflow cannot occur. \nSee also g_strdup_vprintf. \nIn versions of GLib prior to this function may return if the output was truncated and the truncated string may not be nul terminated. In versions prior to this function returns the length of the output string. \nThe return value of g_vsnprintf conforms to the vsnprintf function as standardized in ISO C99. Note that this is different from traditional vsnprintf which returns the length of the output string. \nThe format string may contain positional parameters as specified in the Single Unix Specification. \n"});
