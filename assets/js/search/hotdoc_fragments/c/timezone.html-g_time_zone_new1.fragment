There are no spaces in the specification. The name of standard and daylight savings time zone must be three or more alphabetic characters. Offsets are time values to be added to local time to get Coordinated Universal Time UTC and should be hh mm ss Dates are either Jn Julian day with n between and leap years not counted n zero based Julian day with n between and or Mm.w.d day d d of week w w of month m m day is a Sunday Times are in local wall clock time the default is \nIn Windows the tzn hh mm ss dzn format is used but also accepts POSIX format. The Windows format uses US rules for all time zones daylight savings time is minutes behind the standard time with date and time of change taken from Pacific Standard Time. Offsets are time values to be added to the local time to get Coordinated Universal Time UTC \ng_time_zone_new_local calls this function with the value of the TZ environment variable. This function itself is independent of the value of TZ but if identifier is NULL then etc localtime will be consulted to discover the correct time zone on UNIX and the registry will be consulted or GetTimeZoneInformation will be used to get the local time zone on Windows. \nIf intervals are not available only time zone rules from TZ environment variable or other means then they will be computed from year to If the maximum year for the rules is available and it is greater than then it will followed instead. \nSee RFC3339 for a precise definition of valid RFC3339 time offsets the time offset expansion and ISO for the full list of valid time offsets. See The GNU C Library manual for an explanation of the possible values of the TZ environment variable. See Microsoft Time Zone Index Values for the list of time zones on Windows. \nYou should release the return value by calling g_time_zone_unref when you are done with it. \n"});
