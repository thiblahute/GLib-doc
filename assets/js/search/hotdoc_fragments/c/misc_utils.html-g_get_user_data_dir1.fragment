fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/misc_utils.html#g_get_user_data_dir1", "fragment": "g_get_user_data_dir \nReturns a base directory in which to access application data such as icons that is customized for a particular user. \nOn UNIX platforms this is determined using the mechanisms described in the XDG Base Directory Specification. In this case the directory retrieved will be XDG_DATA_HOME. \nOn Windows this is the folder to use for local as opposed to roaming application data. See documentation for CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA. Note that on Windows it thus is the same as what g_get_user_config_dir returns. \n"});
