A solution to this particular problem is to check to if the source has already been destroy within the callback. \nCalls to this function from a thread other than the one acquired by the GMainContext the GSource is attached to are typically redundant as the source could be destroyed immediately after this function returns. However once a source is destroyed it cannot be un destroyed so this function can be used for opportunistic checks from any thread. \n"});
