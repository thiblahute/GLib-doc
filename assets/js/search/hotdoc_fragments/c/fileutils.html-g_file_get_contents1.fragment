The string stored in contents will be nul terminated so for text files you can pass NULL for the length argument. If the call was not successful it returns FALSE and sets error. The error domain is G_FILE_ERROR. Possible error codes are those in the GFileError enumeration. In the error case contents is set to NULL and length is set to zero. \n"});
