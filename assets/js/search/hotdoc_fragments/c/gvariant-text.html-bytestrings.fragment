It constructs arrays of non nul bytes type ay with a nul terminator at the end. \nBytestrings are specified with either b or b As with strings there is no fundamental difference between the two different types of quotes. \nBytestrings support the full range of escapes that you would expect ie those supported by g_strcompress This includes the normal control sequence escapes as mentioned in the section on strings as well as octal and hexidecimal escapes of the forms nnn and xnn. \nb abc is equivalent to byte x97 x98 x99 \nWhen formatting arrays of bytes the printer will choose to display the array as a bytestring if it contains a nul character at the end and no other nul bytes within. Otherwise it is formatted as a normal array. \n"});
