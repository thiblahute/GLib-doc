fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/macros.html#g_const_return", "fragment": "G_CONST_RETURN \nIf G_DISABLE_CONST_RETURNS is defined this macro expands to nothing. By default the macro expands to const. The macro can be used in place of const for functions that return a value that should not be modified. The purpose of this macro is to allow us to turn on const for returned constant strings by default while allowing programmers who find that annoying to turn it off. This macro should only be used for return values and for out parameters it doesn t make sense for in parameters. \n"});
