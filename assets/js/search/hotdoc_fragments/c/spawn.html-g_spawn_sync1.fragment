Note that you must set the G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL and G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL flags when passing NULL for standard_output and standard_error. \nIf exit_status is non NULL the platform specific exit status of the child is stored there see the documentation of g_spawn_check_exit_status for how to use and interpret this. Note that it is invalid to pass G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD in flags. \nIf an error occurs no data is returned in standard_output standard_error or exit_status. \nThis function calls g_spawn_async_with_pipes internally see that function for full details on the other parameters and details on how these functions work on Windows. \n"});
