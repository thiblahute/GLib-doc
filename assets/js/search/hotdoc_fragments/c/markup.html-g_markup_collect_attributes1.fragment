It is an error to specify multiple attributes with the same name. If any attribute not in the list appears in the attribute_names array then an unknown attribute error will result. \nThe GMarkupCollectType field allows specifying the type of collection to perform and if a given attribute must appear or is optional. \nThe attribute name is simply the name of the attribute to collect. \nThe pointer should be of the appropriate type see the descriptions under GMarkupCollectType and may be NULL in case a particular attribute is to be allowed but ignored. \nThis function deals with issuing errors for missing attributes of type G_MARKUP_ERROR_MISSING_ATTRIBUTE unknown attributes of type G_MARKUP_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE and duplicate attributes of type G_MARKUP_ERROR_INVALID_CONTENT as well as parse errors for boolean valued attributes again of type G_MARKUP_ERROR_INVALID_CONTENT In all of these cases FALSE will be returned and error will be set as appropriate. \n"});
