Copies src to dest dest is guaranteed to be nul terminated src must be nul terminated dest_size is the buffer size not the number of bytes to copy. \nAt most dest_size characters will be copied. Always nul terminates unless dest_size is This function does not allocate memory. Unlike strncpy this function doesn t pad dest so it s often faster It returns the size of the attempted result strlen src so if retval dest_size truncation occurred. \nCaveat strlcpy is supposedly more secure than strcpy or strncpy but if you really want to avoid screwups g_strdup is an even better idea. \n"});
