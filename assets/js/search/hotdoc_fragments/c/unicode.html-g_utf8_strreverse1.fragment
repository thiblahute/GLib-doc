Use g_utf8_validate on all text before trying to use UTF utility functions with it. \nThis function is intended for programmatic uses of reversed strings. It pays no attention to decomposed characters combining marks byte order marks directional indicators LRM LRO etc and similar characters which might need special handling when reversing a string for display purposes. \nNote that unlike g_strreverse this function returns newly allocated memory which should be freed with g_free when no longer needed. \n"});
