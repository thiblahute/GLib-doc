Variable arguments are collected as specified by the format string and the resulting value is inserted at the current position. \nThis feature is best explained by example \nThis constructs a dictionary mapping strings to variants type a sv with two items in it. The key names are parsed from the string and the values for those keys are taken as variable arguments parameters. \nThe arguments are always collected in the order that they appear in the string to be parsed. Format strings that collect multiple arguments are permitted so you may require more varargs parameters than the number of signs that appear. You can also give format strings that collect no arguments but there s no good reason to do so. \n"});
