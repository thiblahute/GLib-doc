fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_builder_init2", "fragment": "G_VARIANT_BUILDER_INIT \nA stack allocated GVariantBuilder must be initialized if it is used together with g_auto to avoid warnings or crashes if function returns before g_variant_builder_init is called on the builder. This macro can be used as initializer instead of an explicit zeroing a variable when declaring it and a following g_variant_builder_init but it cannot be assigned to a variable. \nThe passed variant_type should be a static GVariantType to avoid lifetime issues as copying the variant_type does not happen in the G_VARIANT_BUILDER_INIT call but rather in functions that make sure that GVariantBuilder is valid. \n"});
