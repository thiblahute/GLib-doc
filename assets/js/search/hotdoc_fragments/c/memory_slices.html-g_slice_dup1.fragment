fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/memory_slices.html#g_slice_dup1", "fragment": "g_slice_dup \nA convenience macro to duplicate a block of memory using the slice allocator. \nIt calls g_slice_copy with sizeof type and casts the returned pointer to a pointer of the given type avoiding a type cast in the source code. Note that the underlying slice allocation mechanism can be changed with the G_SLICE always malloc G_SLICE environment variable. \nThis can never return NULL. \n"});
