fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_private_init", "fragment": "G_PRIVATE_INIT \nA macro to assist with the static initialisation of a GPrivate. \nThis macro is useful for the case that a GDestroyNotify function should be associated the key. This is needed when the key will be used to point at memory that should be deallocated when the thread exits. \nAdditionally the GDestroyNotify will also be called on the previous value stored in the key when g_private_replace is used. \nIf no GDestroyNotify is needed then use of this macro is not required if the GPrivate is declared in static scope then it will be properly initialised by default ie to all zeros See the examples below. \n"});
