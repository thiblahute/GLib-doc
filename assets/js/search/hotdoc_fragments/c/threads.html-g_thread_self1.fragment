fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_thread_self1", "fragment": "g_thread_self \nThis function returns the GThread corresponding to the current thread. Note that this function does not increase the reference count of the returned struct. \nThis function will return a GThread even for threads that were not created by GLib i.e. those created by other threading APIs This may be useful for thread identification purposes i.e. comparisons but you must not use GLib functions such as g_thread_join on these threads. \n"});
