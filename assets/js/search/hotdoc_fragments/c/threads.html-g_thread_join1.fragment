If thread has already terminated then g_thread_join returns immediately. \nAny thread can wait for any other thread by calling g_thread_join not just its creator Calling g_thread_join from multiple threads for the same thread leads to undefined behaviour. \nThe value returned by func or given to g_thread_exit is returned by this function. \ng_thread_join consumes the reference to the passed in thread. This will usually cause the GThread struct and associated resources to be freed. Use g_thread_ref to obtain an extra reference if you want to keep the GThread alive beyond the g_thread_join call. \n"});
