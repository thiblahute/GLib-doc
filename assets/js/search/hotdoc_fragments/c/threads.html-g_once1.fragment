Thereafter subsequent calls to g_once with the same GOnce struct do not call func again but return the stored result of the first call. On return from g_once the status of once will be G_ONCE_STATUS_READY. \nFor example a mutex or a thread specific data key must be created exactly once. In a threaded environment calling g_once ensures that the initialization is serialized across multiple threads. \nCalling g_once recursively on the same GOnce struct in func will lead to a deadlock. \n"});
