fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#g_cond_wait1", "fragment": "g_cond_wait \nAtomically releases mutex and waits until cond is signalled. When this function returns mutex is locked again and owned by the calling thread. \nWhen using condition variables it is possible that a spurious wakeup may occur ie g_cond_wait returns even though g_cond_signal was not called It s also possible that a stolen wakeup may occur. This is when g_cond_signal is called but another thread acquires mutex before this thread and modifies the state of the program in such a way that when g_cond_wait is able to return the expected condition is no longer met. \nFor this reason g_cond_wait must always be used in a loop. See the documentation for GCond for a complete example. \n"});
