fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/fileutils.html#g_remove1", "fragment": "g_remove \nA wrapper for the POSIX remove function. The remove function deletes a name from the filesystem. \nSee your C library manual for more details about how remove works on your system. On Unix remove removes also directories as it calls unlink for files and rmdir for directories. On Windows although remove in the C library only works for files this function tries first remove and then if that fails rmdir and thus works for both files and directories. Note however that on Windows it is in general not possible to remove a file that is open to some process or mapped into memory. \nIf this function fails on Windows you can t infer too much from the errno value. rmdir is tried regardless of what caused remove to fail. Any errno value set by remove will be overwritten by that set by rmdir. \n"});
