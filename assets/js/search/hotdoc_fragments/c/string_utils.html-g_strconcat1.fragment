fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/string_utils.html#g_strconcat1", "fragment": "g_strconcat \nConcatenates all of the given strings into one long string. The returned string should be freed with g_free when no longer needed. \nThe variable argument list must end with NULL. If you forget the NULL g_strconcat will start appending random memory junk to your string. \nNote that this function is usually not the right function to use to assemble a translated message from pieces since proper translation often requires the pieces to be reordered. \n"});
