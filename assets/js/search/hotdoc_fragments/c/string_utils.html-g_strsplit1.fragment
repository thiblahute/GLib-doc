fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/string_utils.html#g_strsplit1", "fragment": "g_strsplit \nSplits a string into a maximum of max_tokens pieces using the given delimiter. If max_tokens is reached the remainder of string is appended to the last token. \nAs an example the result of g_strsplit a bc d is a NULL terminated vector containing the six strings a bc d and \nAs a special case the result of splitting the empty string is an empty vector not a vector containing a single string. The reason for this special case is that being able to represent a empty vector is typically more useful than consistent handling of empty elements. If you do need to represent empty elements you ll need to check for the empty string before calling g_strsplit. \n"});
