fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/fileutils.html#g_stat1", "fragment": "g_stat \nA wrapper for the POSIX stat function. The stat function returns information about a file. On Windows the stat function in the C library checks only the FAT style READONLY attribute and does not look at the ACL at all. Thus on Windows the protection bits in the st_mode field are a fabrication of little use. \nOn Windows the Microsoft C libraries have several variants of the stat struct and stat function with names like _stat _stat32 _stat32i64 and _stat64i32. The one used here is for bit code the one with bit size and time fields specifically called _stat32. \nIn Microsoft s compiler by default struct stat means one with bit time fields while in MinGW struct stat is the legacy one with bit fields. To hopefully clear up this messs the gstdio.h header defines a type GStatBuf which is the appropriate struct type depending on the platform and or compiler being used. On POSIX it is just struct stat but note that even on POSIX platforms stat might be a macro. \nSee your C library manual for more details about stat. \n"});
