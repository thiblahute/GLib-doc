This function uses a different algorithm so it can retrieve all the possible matches. For more documentation see g_regex_match_all_full. \nA GMatchInfo structure used to get information on the match is stored in match_info if not NULL. Note that if match_info is not NULL then it is created even if the function returns FALSE i.e. you must free it regardless if regular expression actually matched. \nstring is not copied and is used in GMatchInfo internally. If you use any GMatchInfo method except g_match_info_free after freeing or modifying string then the behaviour is undefined. \n"});
