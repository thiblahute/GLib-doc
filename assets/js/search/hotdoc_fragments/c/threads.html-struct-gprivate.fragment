fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/threads.html#struct-gprivate", "fragment": "struct GPrivate \nThe GPrivate struct is an opaque data structure to represent a thread local data key. It is approximately equivalent to the pthread_setspecific pthread_getspecific APIs on POSIX and to TlsSetValue TlsGetValue on Windows. \nIf you don t already know why you might want this functionality then you probably don t need it. \nGPrivate is a very limited resource as far as per program shared between all libraries It is also not possible to destroy a GPrivate after it has been used. As such it is only ever acceptable to use GPrivate in static scope and even then sparingly so. \nSee G_PRIVATE_INIT for a couple of examples. \nThe GPrivate structure should be considered opaque. It should only be accessed via the g_private_ functions. \n"});
