When a message with any of these levels is logged the program terminates. You can only set the levels defined by GLib to be fatal. G_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR is always fatal. \nYou can also make some message levels fatal at runtime by setting the G_DEBUG environment variable see Running GLib Applications \nLibraries should not call this function as it affects all messages logged by a process including those from other libraries. \nStructured log messages using g_log_structured and g_log_structured_array are fatal only if the default log writer is used otherwise it is up to the writer function to determine which log messages are fatal.
