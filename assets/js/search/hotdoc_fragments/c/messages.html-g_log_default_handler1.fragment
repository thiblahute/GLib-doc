This is used if no log handler has been set for the particular log domain and log level combination. It outputs the message to stderr or stdout and if the log level is fatal it calls abort. It automatically prints a new line character after the message so one does not need to be manually included in message. \nThe behavior of this log handler can be influenced by a number of environment variables \nG_MESSAGES_PREFIXED A separated list of log levels for which messages should be prefixed by the program name and PID of the aplication. \nG_MESSAGES_DEBUG A space separated list of log domains for which debug and informational messages are printed. By default these messages are not printed. \nstderr is used for levels G_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR G_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL G_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING and G_LOG_LEVEL_MESSAGE. stdout is used for the rest. \nThis has no effect if structured logging is enabled see Using Structured Logging using structured logging \n"});
