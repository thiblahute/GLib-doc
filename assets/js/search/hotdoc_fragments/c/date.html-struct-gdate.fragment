fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/date.html#struct-gdate", "fragment": "struct GDate \nRepresents a day between January Year and a few thousand years in the future. None of its members should be accessed directly. \nIf the GDate struct is obtained from g_date_new it will be safe to mutate but invalid and thus not safe for calendrical computations. \nIf it s declared on the stack it will contain garbage so must be initialized with g_date_clear. g_date_clear makes the date invalid but sane. An invalid date doesn t represent a day it s empty. A date becomes valid after you set it to a Julian day or you set a day month and year. \n"});
