GVariant allows just to be omitted in every case that it is able to unambiguously determine the intention of the writer. There are two cases where it must be specified \nwhen using nested maybes in order to specify the just nothing case \nto establish the nullability of the type of a value without explicitly specifying its full type \nSome examples \njust hello parses as a non null nullable string. \nms hello is the same demonstrating how just can be dropped if the type is already known \nnothing will not parse wtihout extra type information. \nms nothing parses as a null nullable string. \njust nothing is an array of nullable integers \nnothing is the same as the above demonstrating another place were just can be dropped \njust nothing parses as an array of maybe maybe integers type ammi \n"});
