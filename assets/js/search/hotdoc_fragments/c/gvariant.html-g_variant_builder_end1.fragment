fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_builder_end1", "fragment": "g_variant_builder_end \nEnds the builder process and returns the constructed value. \nIt is not permissible to use builder in any way after this call except for reference counting operations in the case of a heap allocated GVariantBuilder or by reinitialising it with g_variant_builder_init in the case of stack allocated This means that for the stack allocated builders there is no need to call g_variant_builder_clear after the call to g_variant_builder_end. \nIt is an error to call this function in any way that would create an inconsistent value to be constructed ie insufficient number of items added to a container with a specific number of children required It is also an error to call this function if the builder was created with an indefinite array or maybe type and no children have been added in this case it is impossible to infer the type of the empty array. \n"});
