fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/i18n.html#g_dpgettext1", "fragment": "g_dpgettext \nThis function is a variant of g_dgettext which supports a disambiguating message context. GNU gettext uses the character to separate the message context and message id in msgctxtid. If is passed as msgidoffset this function will fall back to trying to use the deprecated convention of using as a separation character. \nThis uses g_dgettext internally. See that functions for differences with dgettext proper. \nApplications should normally not use this function directly but use the C_ macro for translations with context. \n"});
