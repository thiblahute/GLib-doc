fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/gvariant.html#g_variant_iter_next1", "fragment": "g_variant_iter_next \nGets the next item in the container and unpacks it into the variable argument list according to format_string returning TRUE. \nIf no more items remain then FALSE is returned. \nAll of the pointers given on the variable arguments list of this function are assumed to point at uninitialised memory. It is the responsibility of the caller to free all of the values returned by the unpacking process. \nHere is an example for memory management with g_variant_iter_next \nFor a solution that is likely to be more convenient to C programmers when dealing with loops see g_variant_iter_loop. \nformat_string determines the C types that are used for unpacking the values and also determines if the values are copied or borrowed. \nSee the section on GVariant format strings gvariant format strings pointers \n"});
