It can be passed to g_hash_table_new as the key_equal_func parameter when using non NULL pointers to integers as keys in a GHashTable. \nNote that this function acts on pointers to gint not on gint directly if your hash table s keys are of the form GINT_TO_POINTER n use g_direct_equal instead. \n"});
