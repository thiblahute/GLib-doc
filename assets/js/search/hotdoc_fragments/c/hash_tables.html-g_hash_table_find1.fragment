The function is passed the key and value of each pair and the given user_data parameter. The hash table may not be modified while iterating over it you can t add remove items \nNote that hash tables are really only optimized for forward lookups i.e. g_hash_table_lookup. So code that frequently issues g_hash_table_find or g_hash_table_foreach e.g. in the order of once per every entry in a hash table should probably be reworked to use additional or different data structures for reverse lookups keep in mind that an O n find foreach operation issued for all n values in a hash table ends up needing O n n operations \n"});
