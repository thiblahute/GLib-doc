Otherwise cause the next invocation of g_main_context_iteration to return without blocking. \nThis API is useful for low level control over GMainContext for example integrating it with main loop implementations such as GMainLoop. \nAnother related use for this function is when implementing a main loop with a termination condition computed from multiple threads \nThen in a thread \n"});
