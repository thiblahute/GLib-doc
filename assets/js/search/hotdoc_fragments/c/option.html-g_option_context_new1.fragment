fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "c/option.html#g_option_context_new1", "fragment": "g_option_context_new \nCreates a new option context. \nThe parameter_string can serve multiple purposes. It can be used to add descriptions for rest arguments which are not parsed by the GOptionContext typically something like FILES or FILE1 FILE2... If you are using G_OPTION_REMAINING for collecting rest arguments GLib handles this automatically by using the arg_description of the corresponding GOptionEntry in the usage summary. \nAnother usage is to give a short summary of the program functionality like frob the strings which will be displayed in the same line as the usage. For a longer description of the program functionality that should be displayed as a paragraph below the usage line use g_option_context_set_summary. \nNote that the parameter_string is translated using the function set with g_option_context_set_translate_func so it should normally be passed untranslated. \n"});
