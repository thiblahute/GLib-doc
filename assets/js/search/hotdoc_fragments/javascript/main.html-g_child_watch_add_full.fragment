Typically you should invoke GLib.prototype.spawn_close_pid in the callback function for the source. \nGLib supports only a single callback per process id. \nThis internally creates a main loop source using GLib.prototype.child_watch_source_new and attaches it to the main loop context using GLib.Source.prototype.attach. You can do these steps manually if you need greater control. \n"});
