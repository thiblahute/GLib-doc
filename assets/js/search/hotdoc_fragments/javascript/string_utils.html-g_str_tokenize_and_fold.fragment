An alphanumeric character for this purpose is one that matches GLib.prototype.unichar_isalnum or GLib.prototype.unichar_ismark. \nEach token is then Unicode normalised and case folded. If ascii_alternates is non NULL and some of the returned tokens contain non ASCII characters ASCII alternatives will be generated. \nThe number of ASCII alternatives that are generated and the method for doing so is unspecified but translit_locale if specified may improve the transliteration if the language of the source string is known. \n"});
