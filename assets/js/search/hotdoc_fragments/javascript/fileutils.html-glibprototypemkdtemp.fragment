See the mkdtemp documentation on most UNIX like systems. \nThe parameter is a string that should follow the rules for mkdtemp templates i.e. contain the string XXXXXX GLib.prototype.mkdtemp is slightly more flexible than mkdtemp in that the sequence does not have to occur at the very end of the template.
