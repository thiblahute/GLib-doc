fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/unicode.html#g_utf8_offset_to_pointer", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.utf8_offset_to_pointer \nConverts from an integer character offset to a pointer to a position within the string. \nSince this function allows to pass a negative offset to step backwards. It is usually worth stepping backwards from the end instead of forwards if offset is in the last fourth of the string since moving forward is about times faster than moving backward. \nNote that this function doesn t abort when reaching the end of str. Therefore you should be sure that offset is within string boundaries before calling that function. Call GLib.prototype.utf8_strlen when unsure. This limitation exists as this function is called frequently during text rendering and therefore has to be as fast as possible. \n"});
