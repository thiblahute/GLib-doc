fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/patterns.html#glibprototypepattern_match", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.pattern_match \nMatches a string against a compiled pattern. Passing the correct length of the string given is mandatory. The reversed string can be omitted by passing null this is more efficient if the reversed version of the string to be matched is not at hand as GLib.prototype.pattern_match will only construct it if the compiled pattern requires reverse matches. \nNote that if the user code will possibly match a string against a multitude of patterns containing wildcards chances are high that some patterns will require a reversed string. In this case it s more efficient to provide the reversed string to avoid multiple constructions thereof in the various calls to GLib.prototype.pattern_match. \nNote also that the reverse of a UTF encoded string can in general not be obtained by GLib.prototype.strreverse. This works only if the string does not contain any multibyte characters. GLib offers the GLib.prototype.utf8_strreverse function to reverse UTF encoded strings. \n"});
