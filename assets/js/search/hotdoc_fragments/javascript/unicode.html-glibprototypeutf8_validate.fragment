If end is non NULL then the end of the valid range will be stored there i.e. the start of the first invalid character if some bytes were invalid or the end of the text being validated otherwise \nNote that GLib.prototype.utf8_validate returns false if max_len is positive and any of the max_len bytes are nul. \nReturns true if all of str was valid. Many GLib and GTK routines require valid UTF as input so data read from a file or the network should be checked with GLib.prototype.utf8_validate before doing anything else with it. \n"});
