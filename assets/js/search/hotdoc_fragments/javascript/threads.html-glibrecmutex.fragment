fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/threads.html#glibrecmutex", "fragment": "GLib.RecMutex \nThe GRecMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a recursive mutex. It is similar to a GMutex with the difference that it is possible to lock a GRecMutex multiple times in the same thread without deadlock. When doing so care has to be taken to unlock the recursive mutex as often as it has been locked. \nIf a GLib.RecMutex is allocated in static storage then it can be used without initialisation. Otherwise you should call GLib.RecMutex.prototype.init on it and GLib.RecMutex.prototype.clear when done. \nA GRecMutex should only be accessed with the g_rec_mutex_ functions. \n"});
