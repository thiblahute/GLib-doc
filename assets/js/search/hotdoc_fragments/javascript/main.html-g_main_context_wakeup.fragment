Otherwise cause the next invocation of GLib.MainContext.prototype.iteration to return without blocking. \nThis API is useful for low level control over GLib.MainContext for example integrating it with main loop implementations such as GLib.MainLoop. \nAnother related use for this function is when implementing a main loop with a termination condition computed from multiple threads \nThen in a thread \n"});
