If mutex is already locked by another thread it immediately returns false. Otherwise it locks mutex and returns true. \nGMutex is neither guaranteed to be recursive nor to be non recursive. As such calling GLib.Mutex.prototype.lock on a GMutex that has already been locked by the same thread results in undefined behaviour including but not limited to deadlocks or arbitrary return values \n"});
