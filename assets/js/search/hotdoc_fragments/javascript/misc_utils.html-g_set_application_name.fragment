This name should be localized if possible and is intended for display to the user. Contrast with GLib.prototype.set_prgname which sets a non localized name. GLib.prototype.set_prgname will be called automatically by gtk_init but GLib.prototype.set_application_name will not. \nNote that for thread safety reasons this function can only be called once. \nThe application name will be used in contexts such as error messages or when displaying an application s name in the task list. \n"});
