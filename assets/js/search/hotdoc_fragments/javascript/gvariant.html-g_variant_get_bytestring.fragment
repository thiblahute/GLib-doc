fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/gvariant.html#g_variant_get_bytestring", "fragment": "GLib.Variant.prototype.get_bytestring \nReturns the string value of a GLib.Variant instance with an array of bytes type. The string has no particular encoding. \nIf the array does not end with a nul terminator character the empty string is returned. For this reason you can always trust that a non NULL nul terminated string will be returned by this function. \nIf the array contains a nul terminator character somewhere other than the last byte then the returned string is the string up to the first such nul character. \ng_variant_get_fixed_array not introspectable should be used instead if the array contains arbitrary data that could not be nul terminated or could contain nul bytes. \nIt is an error to call this function with a value that is not an array of bytes. \nThe return value remains valid as long as value exists. \n"});
