See also GLib.GINT16_FORMAT. \nSome platforms do not support scanning and printing bit integers even though the types are supported. On such platforms GLib.GINT64_FORMAT is not defined. Note that scanf may not support bit integers even if GLib.GINT64_FORMAT is defined. Due to its weak error handling scanf is not recommended for parsing anyway consider using GLib.prototype.ascii_strtoull instead. \n"});
