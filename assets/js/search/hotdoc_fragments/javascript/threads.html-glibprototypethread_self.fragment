Note that this function does not increase the reference count of the returned struct. \nThis function will return a GLib.Thread even for threads that were not created by GLib i.e. those created by other threading APIs This may be useful for thread identification purposes i.e. comparisons but you must not use GLib functions such as GLib.Thread.prototype.join on these threads. \n"});
