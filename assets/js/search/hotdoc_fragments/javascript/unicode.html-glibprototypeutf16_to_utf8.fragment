GLib.prototype.convert can be used to convert a byte buffer of UTF data of ambiguous endianess. \nFurther note that this function does not validate the result string it may e.g. include embedded NUL characters. The only validation done by this function is to ensure that the input can be correctly interpreted as UTF i.e. it doesn t contain things unpaired surrogates. \n"});
