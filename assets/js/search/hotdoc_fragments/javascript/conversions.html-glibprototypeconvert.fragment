Despite the fact that byes_read can return information about partial characters the g_convert_... functions are not generally suitable for streaming. If the underlying converter maintains internal state then this won t be preserved across successive calls to GLib.prototype.convert GLib.prototype.convert_with_iconv or GLib.prototype.convert_with_fallback. An example of this is the GNU C converter for CP1255 which does not emit a base character until it knows that the next character is not a mark that could combine with the base character. \nUsing extensions such as TRANSLIT may not work or may not work well on many platforms. Consider using GLib.prototype.str_to_ascii instead. \n"});
