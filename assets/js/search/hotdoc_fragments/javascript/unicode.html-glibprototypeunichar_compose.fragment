fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/unicode.html#glibprototypeunichar_compose", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.unichar_compose \nPerforms a single composition step of the Unicode canonical composition algorithm. \nThis function includes algorithmic Hangul Jamo composition but it is not exactly the inverse of GLib.prototype.unichar_decompose. No composition can have either of a or b equal to zero. To be precise this function composes if and only if there exists a Primary Composite P which is canonically equivalent to the sequence a b See the Unicode Standard for the definition of Primary Composite. \nIf a and b do not compose a new character ch is set to zero. \nSee UAX for details. \n"});
