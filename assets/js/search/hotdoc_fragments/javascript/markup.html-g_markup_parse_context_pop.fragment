It must be called in the end_element handler corresponding to the start_element handler during which GLib.MarkupParseContext.prototype.push was called. You must not call this function from the error callback the user_data is provided directly to the callback in that case. \nThis function is not intended to be directly called by users interested in invoking subparsers. Instead it is intended to be used by the subparsers themselves to implement a higher level interface. \n"});
