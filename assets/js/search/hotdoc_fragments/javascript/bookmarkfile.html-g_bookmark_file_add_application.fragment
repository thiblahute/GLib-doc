Each application must provide a name a command line useful for launching the bookmark the number of times the bookmark has been registered by the application and the last time the application registered this bookmark. \nIf name is null the name of the application will be the same returned by GLib.prototype.get_application_name if exec is null the command line will be a composition of the program name as returned by GLib.prototype.get_prgname and the u modifier which will be expanded to the bookmark s URI. \nThis function will automatically take care of updating the registrations count and timestamping in case an application with the same name had already registered a bookmark for uri inside bookmark. \nIf no bookmark for uri is found one is created. \n"});
