This function uses a different algorithm so it can retrieve all the possible matches. For more documentation see GLib.Regex.prototype.match_all_full. \nA GLib.MatchInfo structure used to get information on the match is stored in match_info if not null. Note that if match_info is not null then it is created even if the function returns false i.e. you must free it regardless if regular expression actually matched. \nstring is not copied and is used in GLib.MatchInfo internally. If you use any GLib.MatchInfo method except GLib.MatchInfo.prototype.free after freeing or modifying string then the behaviour is undefined. \n"});
