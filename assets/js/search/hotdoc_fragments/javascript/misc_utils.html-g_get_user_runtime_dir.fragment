This is the directory specified in the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable. In the case that this variable is not set we return the value of GLib.prototype.get_user_cache_dir after verifying that it exists. \nOn Windows this is the folder to use for local as opposed to roaming application data. See documentation for CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA. Note that on Windows it thus is the same as what GLib.prototype.get_user_config_dir returns. \n"});
