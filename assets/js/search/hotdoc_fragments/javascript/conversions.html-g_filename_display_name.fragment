The conversion is not necessarily reversible so you should keep the original around and use the return value of this function only for display purposes. Unlike GLib.prototype.filename_to_utf8 the result is guaranteed to be non NULL even if the filename actually isn t in the GLib file name encoding. \nIf GLib cannot make sense of the encoding of filename as a last resort it replaces unknown characters with U FFFD the Unicode replacement character. You can search the result for the UTF encoding of this character which is in octal notation to find out if filename was in an invalid encoding. \nIf you know the whole pathname of the file you should use GLib.prototype.filename_display_basename since that allows location based translation of filenames. \n"});
