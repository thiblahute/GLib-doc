Remaining arguments are treated as non options and are not attempted to be parsed. \nIf strict POSIX mode is disabled then parsing is done in the GNU way where option arguments can be freely mixed with non options. \nAs an example consider ls foo l With GNU style parsing this will list foo in long mode. In strict POSIX style this will list the files named foo and l \nIt may be useful to force strict POSIX mode when creating verb style command line tools. For example the gsettings command line tool supports the global option schemadir as well as many subcommands get set etc. which each have their own set of arguments. Using strict POSIX mode will allow parsing the global options up to the verb name while leaving the remaining options to be parsed by the relevant subcommand which can be determined by examining the verb name which should be present in argv after parsing \n"});
