However it is impossible to handle things correctly from an internationalization standpoint by operating on bytes since characters may be multibyte. Thus g_strncasecmp is broken if your string is guaranteed to be ASCII since it is locale sensitive and it s broken if your string is localized since it doesn t work on many encodings at all including UTF EUC JP etc. There are therefore two replacement techniques g_ascii_strncasecmp which only works on ASCII and is not locale sensitive and g_utf8_casefold followed by strcmp on the resulting strings which is good for case insensitive sorting of UTF \n"});
