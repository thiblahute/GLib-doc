In UTF a character might be more than one byte long. \nWhen a line ending is defined as a single character dot never matches that character when the two character sequence CRLF is used dot does not match CR if it is immediately followed by LF but otherwise it matches all characters including isolated CRs and LFs When any Unicode line endings are being recognized dot does not match CR or LF or any of the other line ending characters. \nIf the G_REGEX_DOTALL flag is set dots match newlines as well. The handling of dot is entirely independent of the handling of circumflex and dollar the only relationship being that they both involve newline characters. Dot has no special meaning in a character class. \nThe behaviour of dot with regard to newlines can be changed. If the G_REGEX_DOTALL option is set a dot matches any one character without exception. If newline is defined as the two character sequence CRLF it takes two dots to match it. \nThe handling of dot is entirely independent of the handling of circumflex and dollar the only relationship being that they both involve newlines.
