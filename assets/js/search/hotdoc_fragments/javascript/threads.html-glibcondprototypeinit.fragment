It is not necessary to initialise a GLib.Cond that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of GLib.Cond.prototype.init when a GLib.Cond is no longer needed use GLib.Cond.prototype.clear. \nCalling GLib.Cond.prototype.init on an already initialised GLib.Cond leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
