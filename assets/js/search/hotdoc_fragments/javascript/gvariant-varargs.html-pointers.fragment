fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/gvariant-varargs.html#pointers", "fragment": "Pointers \nCharacters \nThe character is used to indicate that serialised data should be directly exchanged via a pointer. \nCurrently the only use for this character is when it is applied to a string ie s o or g For g_variant_new this has absolutely no effect. The string is collected and duplicated normally. For g_variant_get it means that instead of creating a newly allocated copy of the string a pointer to the serialised data is returned. This pointer should not be freed. Validity checks are performed to ensure that the string data will always be properly nul terminated. \n"});
