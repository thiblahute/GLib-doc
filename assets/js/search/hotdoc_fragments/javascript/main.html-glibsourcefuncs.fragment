The prepare function also returns a timeout value of to ensure that the poll call doesn t block since that would be time wasted which could have been spent running the idle function \nFor timeout sources the prepare and check functions both return true if the timeout interval has expired. The prepare function also returns a timeout value to ensure that the poll call doesn t block too long and miss the next timeout. \nFor file descriptor sources the prepare function typically returns false since it must wait until poll has been called before it knows whether any events need to be processed. It sets the returned timeout to to indicate that it doesn t mind how long the poll call blocks. In the check function it tests the results of the poll call to see if the required condition has been met and returns true if so. \n"});
