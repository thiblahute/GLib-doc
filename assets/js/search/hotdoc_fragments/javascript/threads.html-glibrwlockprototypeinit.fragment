It is not necessary to initialise a reader writer lock that has been statically allocated. \nTo undo the effect of GLib.RWLock.prototype.init when a lock is no longer needed use GLib.RWLock.prototype.clear. \nCalling GLib.RWLock.prototype.init on an already initialized GLib.RWLock leads to undefined behaviour. \n"});
