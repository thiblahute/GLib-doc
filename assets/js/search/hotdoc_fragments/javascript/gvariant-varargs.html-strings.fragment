Upon encountering an s o or g in a format string g_variant_new takes a const gchar and makes a copy of it. NULL is not a valid string use maybe types to encode that. If the o or g characters are used care must be taken to ensure that the passed string is a valid DBus object path or DBus type signature respectively. \nUpon encounting s o or g g_variant_get takes a pointer to a gchar ie gchar and sets it to a newly allocated copy of the string. It is appropriate to free this copy using g_free NULL may also be passed to indicate that the value of the string should be ignored in which case no copy is made \n"});
