This will be the case when GLib.prototype.test_fail GLib.prototype.test_incomplete or GLib.prototype.test_skip have been called but also if an assertion has failed. \nThis can be useful to return early from a test if continuing after a failed assertion might be harmful. \nThe return value of this function is only meaningful if it is called from inside a test function. \n"});
