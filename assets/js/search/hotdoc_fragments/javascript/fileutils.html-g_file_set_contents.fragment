fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/fileutils.html#g_file_set_contents", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.file_set_contents \nWrites all of contents to a file named filename with good error checking. If a file called filename already exists it will be overwritten. \nThis write is atomic in the sense that it is first written to a temporary file which is then renamed to the final name. Notes \nOn UNIX if filename already exists hard links to filename will break. Also since the file is recreated existing permissions access control lists metadata etc. may be lost. If filename is a symbolic link the link itself will be replaced not the linked file. \nOn Windows renaming a file will not remove an existing file with the new name so on Windows there is a race condition between the existing file being removed and the temporary file being renamed. \nOn Windows there is no way to remove a file that is open to some process or mapped into memory. Thus this function will fail if filename already exists and is open. \nIf the call was successful it returns true. If the call was not successful it returns false and sets error. The error domain is G_FILE_ERROR not introspectable Possible error codes are those in the GLib.FileError enumeration. \nNote that the name for the temporary file is constructed by appending up to characters to filename. \n"});
