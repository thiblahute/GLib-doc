fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/string_utils.html#glibprototypeascii_strtod", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.ascii_strtod \nConverts a string to a gdouble value. \nThis function behaves like the standard strtod function does in the C locale. It does this without actually changing the current locale since that would not be thread safe. A limitation of the implementation is that this function will still accept localized versions of infinities and NANs. \nThis function is typically used when reading configuration files or other non user input that should be locale independent. To handle input from the user you should normally use the locale sensitive system strtod function. \nTo convert from a gdouble to a string in a locale insensitive way use GLib.prototype.ascii_dtostr. \nIf the correct value would cause overflow plus or minus HUGE_VAL is returned according to the sign of the value and ERANGE is stored in errno. If the correct value would cause underflow zero is returned and ERANGE is stored in errno. \nThis function resets errno before calling strtod so that you can reliably detect overflow and underflow. \n"});
