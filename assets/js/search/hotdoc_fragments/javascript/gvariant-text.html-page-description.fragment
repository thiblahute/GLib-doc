This is what the printer elects to use in the normal case of dictionary entries appearing in an array aka a dictionary The separate syntax for dictionary entries is typically only used for when the entries appear on their own outside of an array which is valid but unusual Of course you are free to use the dictionary entry syntax within arrays but there is no good reason to do so and the printer itself will never do so Note that as with arrays the type of empty dictionaries must be established either explicitly or through inference \nThe dictionary syntax is the same as Python s syntax for dictionaries. Some examples \na sv parses as the empty dictionary of everyone s favourite type. \na sv is the same as above owing to the fact that dictionaries are really arrays \none two three parses as a dictionary mapping integers to strings. \nThe dictionary entry syntax looks just like a pair tuple that uses braces instead of parens. The presence of a comma immediately following the key differentiates it from the dictionary syntax which features a colon after the first key Some examples \none is a free standing dictionary entry that can be parsed on its own or as part of another container value. \none two three is exactly equivalent to the dictionary example given above. \n"});
