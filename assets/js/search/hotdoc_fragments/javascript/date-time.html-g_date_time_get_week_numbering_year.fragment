For other days the number is such that every day within a complete week Monday to Sunday is contained within the same week numbering year. \nFor Monday Tuesday and Wednesday occurring near the end of the year this may mean that the week numbering year is one greater than the calendar year so that these days have the same week numbering year as the Thursday occurring early in the next year \nFor Friday Saturday and Sunday occurring near the start of the year this may mean that the week numbering year is one less than the calendar year so that these days have the same week numbering year as the Thursday occurring late in the previous year \nAn equivalent description is that the week numbering year is equal to the calendar year containing the majority of the days in the current week Monday to Sunday \nNote that January in the proleptic Gregorian calendar is a Monday so this function never returns \n"});
