And note that many functions such as gettext call getenv internally. This function is only safe to use at the very start of your program before creating any other threads or creating objects that create worker threads of their own \nIf you need to set up the environment for a child process you can use GLib.prototype.get_environ to get an environment array modify that with GLib.prototype.environ_setenv and GLib.prototype.environ_unsetenv and then pass that array directly to execvpe GLib.prototype.spawn_async or the like. \n"});
