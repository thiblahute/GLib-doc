By calling this function multiple times you can convert data in chunks to avoid having to have the full encoded data in memory. \nThe output buffer must be large enough to fit all the data that will be written to it. Since base64 encodes bytes in chars you need at least len bytes may be needed in case of non zero state \n"});
