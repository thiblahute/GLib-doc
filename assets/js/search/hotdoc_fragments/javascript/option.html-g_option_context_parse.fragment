A side effect of calling this function is that GLib.prototype.set_prgname will be called. \nIf the parsing is successful any parsed arguments are removed from the array and argc and argv are updated accordingly. A option is stripped from argv unless there are unparsed options before and after it or some of the options after it start with In case of an error argc and argv are left unmodified. \nIf automatic help support is enabled see GLib.OptionContext.prototype.set_help_enabled and the argv array contains one of the recognized help options this function will produce help output to stdout and call exit \nNote that function depends on the current locale setlocale for automatic character set conversion of string and filename arguments. \n"});
