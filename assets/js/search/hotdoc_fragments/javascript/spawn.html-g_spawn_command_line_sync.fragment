fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/spawn.html#g_spawn_command_line_sync", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.spawn_command_line_sync \nA simple version of GLib.prototype.spawn_sync with little used parameters removed taking a command line instead of an argument vector. See GLib.prototype.spawn_sync for full details. command_line will be parsed by GLib.prototype.shell_parse_argv. Unlike GLib.prototype.spawn_sync the GLib.SpawnFlags.prototype.search_path flag is enabled. Note that GLib.SpawnFlags.prototype.search_path can have security implications so consider using GLib.prototype.spawn_sync directly if appropriate. Possible errors are those from GLib.prototype.spawn_sync and those from GLib.prototype.shell_parse_argv. \nIf exit_status is non NULL the platform specific exit status of the child is stored there see the documentation of GLib.prototype.spawn_check_exit_status for how to use and interpret this. \nOn Windows please note the implications of GLib.prototype.shell_parse_argv parsing command_line. Parsing is done according to Unix shell rules not Windows command interpreter rules. Space is a separator and backslashes are special. Thus you cannot simply pass a command_line containing canonical Windows paths like c program files app app.exe as the backslashes will be eaten and the space will act as a separator. You need to enclose such paths with single quotes like c program files app app.exe e folder argument.txt \n"});
