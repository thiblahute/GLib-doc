Frequently GLib.prototype.locale_to_utf8 and GLib.prototype.locale_from_utf8 are nice shortcuts though. \nOn Windows the character set returned by this function is the so called system default ANSI code page. That is the character set used by the narrow versions of C library and Win32 functions that handle file names. It might be different from the character set used by the C library s current locale. \nThe return value is true if the locale s encoding is UTF in that case you can perhaps avoid calling GLib.prototype.convert. \nThe string returned in charset is not allocated and should not be freed. \n"});
