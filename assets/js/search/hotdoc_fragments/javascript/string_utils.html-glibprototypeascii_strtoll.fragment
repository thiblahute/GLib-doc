fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/string_utils.html#glibprototypeascii_strtoll", "fragment": "GLib.prototype.ascii_strtoll \nConverts a string to a gint64 value. This function behaves like the standard strtoll function does in the C locale. It does this without actually changing the current locale since that would not be thread safe. \nThis function is typically used when reading configuration files or other non user input that should be locale independent. To handle input from the user you should normally use the locale sensitive system strtoll function. \nIf the correct value would cause overflow GLib.MAXINT64 or GLib.MININT64 is returned and ERANGE is stored in errno. If the base is outside the valid range zero is returned and EINVAL is stored in errno. If the string conversion fails zero is returned and endptr returns nptr if endptr is non NULL \n"});
