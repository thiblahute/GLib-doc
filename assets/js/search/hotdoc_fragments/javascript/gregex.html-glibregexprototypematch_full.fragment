The match_options are combined with the match options specified when the regex structure was created letting you have more flexibility in reusing GLib.Regex structures. \nSetting start_position differs from just passing over a shortened string and setting GLib.RegexMatchFlags.prototype.notbol in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of lookbehind assertion such as b \nA GLib.MatchInfo structure used to get information on the match is stored in match_info if not null. Note that if match_info is not null then it is created even if the function returns false i.e. you must free it regardless if regular expression actually matched. \nstring is not copied and is used in GLib.MatchInfo internally. If you use any GLib.MatchInfo method except GLib.MatchInfo.prototype.free after freeing or modifying string then the behaviour is undefined. \nTo retrieve all the non overlapping matches of the pattern in string you can use GLib.MatchInfo.prototype.next. \n"});
