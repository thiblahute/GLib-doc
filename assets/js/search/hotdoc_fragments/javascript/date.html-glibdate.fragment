fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "javascript/date.html#glibdate", "fragment": "GLib.Date \nRepresents a day between January Year and a few thousand years in the future. None of its members should be accessed directly. \nIf the GLib.Date struct is obtained from GLib.Date.prototype.new it will be safe to mutate but invalid and thus not safe for calendrical computations. \nIf it s declared on the stack it will contain garbage so must be initialized with GLib.Date.prototype.clear. GLib.Date.prototype.clear makes the date invalid but sane. An invalid date doesn t represent a day it s empty. A date becomes valid after you set it to a Julian day or you set a day month and year. \n"});
