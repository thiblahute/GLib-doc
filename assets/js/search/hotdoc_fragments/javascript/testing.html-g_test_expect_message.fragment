When this message is logged it will not be printed and the test case will not abort. \nThis API may only be used with the old logging API g_log not introspectable without G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED defined It will not work with the structured logging API. See Testing for Messages testing for messages \nUse g_test_assert_expected_messages not introspectable to assert that all previously expected messages have been seen and suppressed. \nYou can call this multiple times in a row if multiple messages are expected as a result of a single call. The messages must appear in the same order as the calls to GLib.prototype.test_expect_message. \nFor example \nNote that you cannot use this to test g_error not introspectable messages since g_error not introspectable intentionally never returns even if the program doesn t abort use GLib.prototype.test_trap_subprocess in this case. \nIf messages at GLib.LogLevelFlags.prototype.level_debug are emitted but not explicitly expected via GLib.prototype.test_expect_message then they will be ignored. \n"});
