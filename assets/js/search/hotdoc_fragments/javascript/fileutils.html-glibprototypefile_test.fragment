For example G_FILE_TEST_EXISTS G_FILE_TEST_IS_DIR will return true if the file exists the check whether it s a directory doesn t matter since the existence test is true. With the current set of available tests there s no point passing in more than one test at a time. \nApart from GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_symlink all tests follow symbolic links so for a symbolic link to a regular file GLib.prototype.file_test will return true for both GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_symlink and GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_regular. \nNote that for a dangling symbolic link GLib.prototype.file_test will return true for GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_symlink and false for all other flags. \nYou should never use GLib.prototype.file_test to test whether it is safe to perform an operation because there is always the possibility of the condition changing before you actually perform the operation. For example you might think you could use GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_symlink to know whether it is safe to write to a file without being tricked into writing into a different location. It doesn t work \nAnother thing to note is that GLib.FileTest.prototype.exists and GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_executable are implemented using the access system call. This usually doesn t matter but if your program is setuid or setgid it means that these tests will give you the answer for the real user ID and group ID rather than the effective user ID and group ID. \nOn Windows there are no symlinks so testing for GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_symlink will always return false. Testing for GLib.FileTest.prototype.is_executable will just check that the file exists and its name indicates that it is executable checking for well known extensions and those listed in the PATHEXT environment variable. \n"});
