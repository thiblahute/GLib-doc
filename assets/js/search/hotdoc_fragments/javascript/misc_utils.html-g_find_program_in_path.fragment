Returns an allocated string with the absolute path name or null if the program is not found in the path. If program is already an absolute path returns a copy of program if program exists and is executable and null otherwise. \nOn Windows if program does not have a file type suffix tries with the suffixes exe cmd bat and com and the suffixes in the PATHEXT environment variable. \nOn Windows it looks for the file in the same way as CreateProcess would. This means first in the directory where the executing program was loaded from then in the current directory then in the Windows bit system directory then in the Windows directory and finally in the directories in the PATH environment variable. If the program is found the return value contains the full name including the type suffix. \n"});
