Numbers are ordered in the usual way. Strings are in ASCII lexographical order. \nIt is a programmer error to attempt to compare container values or two values that have types that are not exactly equal. For example you cannot compare a bit signed integer with a bit unsigned integer. Also note that this function is not particularly well behaved when it comes to comparison of doubles in particular the handling of incomparable values ie NaN is undefined. \nIf you only require an equality comparison GLib.Variant.prototype.equal is more general. \n"});
